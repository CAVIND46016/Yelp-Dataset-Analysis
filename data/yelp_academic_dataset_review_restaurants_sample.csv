ToC77cIEiMas9CPU7dt_fA,7LCG3o2KW2jgKgbKN0DQOg,2012-08-25,2,"I believe in awarding stars bearing in mind the type of restaurant reviewed. 

One can tell by the name that LPW won't replace Ohio's lost Maisonette restaurant in Cincy any time soon, nor does it aspire to do so, but for a sports-bar type venue, these folks do it all right, and do so at the right price!
Stopped for lunch on a Saturday.

The lady got a cheeseburger and fries, I got scrod and broccoli, we split an order of their fried pickles as an app.
The pickles were dill spears coated with just the right amount of what was likely a beer batter and deep fried to tangy perfection.
They got the spears vs. chips decision right!

The lady usually looks askew at this type of fare, but happily camped out over the plate and ate her fair share! 
 
And here's the kicker they were under four bucks! 

Kudos Mr. Pickle; you done good!

The fries were very lightly battered and done perfectly, with just the right amount of crispness outside followed by a creamy interior, ... the fry guy here knows his craft!
And the burger was good as well.. ...typical of the genre.  

I find it difficult to fawn excessively over  a burger.

The scrod was a very generous sized portion, nicely caramelized and served with lemon and butter and perfectly done.
When I was given the option of fries or baked potato or rice I asked if there were a green option and broccoli was offered, it was done perfectly as well and the amount was easily enough for two to share.
My dinner came with a salad, which happily WAS NOT from a bag-o-lettuce, but rather freshly cut romaine, a cuke slice or two, carrot shreds and tomato, and it was accompanied by a store bought dinner roll and butter.

The service was quite good, although the waitress appeared to be a bit over-extended, but that's a management issue, not the server's fault.

Happily they are in the Cleveland Entertainment book, and as I had the coupon sitting on the table during the meal, the waitress took the value off of the ticket before it was even presented!
I'm all for efficiency, especially when it affects how quickly I can get out of a restaurant.

That move garnered the fifth star!

We both stated that we will go back in a heartbeat!",1,5,4P-vTvE6cncJyUyLh73pxw,review,0

Not even in the strip mall I used to hit in Hudson on my dry cleaning route back in the day. There was a deli, but it opened at fucking 11! Who even wants to go to a deli after 11? Weak. Breezed through Peninsula. Winking Lizard? Bah. Ended up backtracking through Brecksville and I remembered an old friend. London Pickle Works! Was it still there some four years after I stopped in while house shopping? Yup. Incidentally, investing in a condo down there probably would have made more sense than buying a house in Lakewood. Live and learn.

Cozied up to the bar and ordered a Killians, plus cheesesteak to go(for pooch). Like the Unicorn, food was amazingly done before I could chug my brew. I could get used to this kind of service. The bar was all old men. Matt, I don't know how you do it. They were watching Fox news for chrissakes!! Total was eight dollars! Holy shit. I dropped a three dollar tip on that barmaid's ass. How could I not? A real meal at fast food prices, at fast food speed, served by someone not under house arrest with work privileges. Busted open the styro box. Big sandwich with mushrooms, onions, cheez and beef sliced so thin I swear it was a Steak'um. I never ate those as a kid, but I remember one time my friend had one in his bedroom where we were playing NES. He didn't want it, so we threw it all around the room. Fries were awesome. Also got a pickle. That's eight dollars with the beer, just to recap. Great value, nice location, old men. I won't wait four more years to come back.",6,4,4P-vTvE6cncJyUyLh73pxw,review,7

So I decided to call and make a reservation since I didnt know whether it was a forsure spot we would get in for dinner. *WHICH I DO RECOMMEND, BTW!* We got there and were greeted and waited in the longue/bar area..it was def cute, we were soon taken to our seats in the patio area (which i also do recommend esp if you come around the 9 o' clock time frame for the pirates show.) OMG, when were going up there are beautiful gold deposit boxes all around then you hit the patio/seating area and you get a great view of the strip AND the pirate show..feels  like the fireworks are going to hit you haha.

You def wont regret it, I ordered the Khotan Beef plate and it was actually good! I wish it did have a little more but I was full forsure. My boyfriend had the Orange chicken plate I believe and he enjoyed that plate as well although he did wish he had more food on there...just b/c hes def a fattie. haha

Spicy tuna roll - just enough spice, quality fish

Don't waste your money on the Jalepeno Hamachi appetizer.  I don't know how anyone could have the nerve to charge $22 for 5 tiny pieces low grade Hamachi (if it even was Hamachi) on a chip.  The Tuna Tartare wasn't that great either...  I've had better hors d'oeuvres at weddings.

I suspect this place may suffer from an expectations standpoint. It is not that expensive, we paid approaching twice the price at Jasmine two nights before for a similar quality meal.

The decor inside is really wonderful, with really interesting jade statues, ivory carvings, and a wall of gold, vault-like boxes. A++ for effort there.

We were seated outside and it was  a nice night.  But, seriously, that Sirens show is craptastic and if you're not a fan, sit inside.

We ordered Khotan lobster, chicken lo mein, brown rice, and a tempura platter.  The sauce in the Khotan lobster is great, but, gasp, it's $36. The chicken lo mein was ""eh,"" very boring and the chicken was slightly overcooked. The tempura platter was delicious but anything fried always is.

Started off w. some edamame (the norm, nothing crazy) then we shared chicken lollipops (not bad), kobe sliders (looked dry but were actually moist), gai lan side dish (cant go wrong w/ veggies) and a noodle dish (don't remember which but it was dry dry dry and super chewy/tough rice noodles...terrible).

It was just a spot we ended up at due to convenience of it's location...right in front of us as we were about to give up looking...

The drinks were great, and my ginger mojito was really refreshing after a long day on my feet. 

The reason this wasn't a 4 star was because my diner was rather salty and not much better than something I would get at my local Chinese take out place. The food was so so, but the drinks, app and atmosphere were great.

Pros:
- nice patio with misters and adequate seating.  Good location to see the show (even if the show is GOD AWFUL- but I won't rate this place according to the show.  My eyes were bleeding after watching it.)
- decent variety of food selections and full bar
- decor and ambience were pretty nice

Cons:
- food was overpriced for the quality.  I had the Teriyaki chicken, which was dry.  California Roll appetizer was dry and fell apart.  The lettuce wraps were decent appetizers, as was the tempura platter.  We ordered a lot of food and were really underwhelmed.  
- service was uninspired and our waitress looked really annoyed to have to walk to our table, which was located a bit out of the way.  She disappeared for a bit while we ate and my husband had to go to the kitchen to get more soy sauce.  We eventually had to call out the Mgr to ask for service, and things got better after that.  He was very apologetic and checked in to make sure things were OK.  

I think if we hadn't had the Groupon, we would have not come here.  Without the Groupon, we would have spent the $200 elsewhere and received much better quality food and service.  I suppose it might be worth it to come and try the lounge area during happy hour.",0,2,4uiijOUDzc-DeIb2XcKW_A,review,0

The sliders were pretty darn tasty with a side of pickled ginger that our server recommended. The Tom Yum was really good too. The asparagus came out ice cold. They brought us another one, but it still wasn't great hot. The coating is way too thick. We all agreed that they use Rice Krispies for the ""fry.""

For dinner, we ordered the Pad Thai (awesome), Khotan beef (decent), and crispy walnut shrimp. All of us like walnut shrimp from Ping Pang Pong and China Mama. We were expecting it to be hot. It was cold. Apparently, that's the way they serve this dish - fried cold shrimp. Once we knew, it wasn't that bad on the bed of vinegary salad. Just wasn't what we were expecting.

Our dessert of mini-cupcakes was comped. The worst cupcakes I've ever had. Three cupcakes - mango, coconut and chocolate, each with their own sauce. I really, really wanted to like them. They didn't taste fresh and were too cold. The cake wasn't fluffy and was really dense.

No skinny Cambodian-looking girl would have an ass that sticks out ten inches from her back unless she stuck a basketball in there, seriously.  Then she told us to go upstairs because that's where the real restaurant is at and we were again greeted by another Asian hostess. While walking upstairs, you would feel like you're in a bank's safe box room because seriously, that's what it looks like, no joke.  Fun to play with, but weird.  Am I missing some sort of cultural significance here? 

The place is dark with small tables, chairs and booths.  It took them ten minutes to hand us the menus after being seated which I thought was incredibly appalling because I'm sure they didn't forget about us.  They have candles on the tables which made it kinda uncomfortable because it seemed too romantic for our own goods (We were hungry and randomly walked into this place).  I ain't gonna lie, the food was good!  We ordered some noodles which tasted like mixed flavors of Chinese and Italian.  Surprise, surprise, it came in a tiny portion that can easily be confused as an appetizer.  WTF mang.  There were just too many selections on the menu (sarcasm) so I ordered an eye roll.  For more than a dub, it's not worth it.  But compared to other rolls I've had at other sushi places, this roll melted in my mouth with just the right amount of flavor, MmmM.  As long as its good, I like it.  

I liked how our waiter came back to refill my friend's drink a couple times without being asked.  I like attentiveness.  I like staffs who pretends to be genuine as good as they're faking it.  Having missed our menus for the first ten minutes, the service is above average.

More importantly, there a few restaurants in Las Vegas that offer a more impressive atmosphere.  Anyone comparing it to ""Panda Express"" or even ""PF Changs"" is simply not doing this place justice.  The modern and sleek decor hasn't changed too much from the days it was Social House except for the fact they have added some stunning jade and ivory sculptures on display.

Most importantly, the food presentation, taste and service are well beyond expectations for a ""reasonably"" priced restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip.

Can you get Asian food as good or better at a lower price down the street (Spring Mountain) in Las Vegas Chinatown?  Yes, of course, but no where near the same dining experience in terms of location, seating (indoor/outdoor), ambiance, and cool vibe.

I would challenge some of those that previously rated this place less than 4 to give it another try.

The lounge was great.  During happy hour (5-7PM) there are drink and app specials. And since ISLA was packed to the gills, my fella and I decided to check out Khotan.  The barkeep was friendly and chatted us up while we sat and watched an NBA game. 

We were so pleased with the service and food (spicy tuna roll -- YUM) that we decided to come back a couple hours later for dinner.

The dining area is upstairs.  Getting up there is quite a sight - floor to ceiling gold drawers. Pretty impressive.  Once seated (inside) we quickly realized we should have sat on the patio.  The inside of the restaurant was dark.  Not mood-making-romantic dark.  More like push-that-candle-here-so-I-can-read-the-menu dark. Oh well.

We ordered a couple entrees (pad thai and singapore style noodles) and a Tom Yum soup.  The soup was super tasty and chocked full of amazingly tender chicken.  My one gripe about the soup...there were pieces of fried scallion (or something...I couldn't really see what it was) that was really fiberous and unpleasant to eat.  I ended up picking it out of my soup.

The pad thai was to die for. Super tasty and a really great portion.  I did raise an eyebrow at the price ($15) - but hey, it's Vegas baby.  My fella loved the singapore style noodles.  He would have licked the plate clean if he wasn't so classy.

We enjoyed a two-for-one cocktail with our complimentary voucher from Treasure Island and both opted for the ginger mojito. (Give me anything with Canton in it and I'm set. Yum.) 

So - let's talk about the service. The servers were polite and great when we saw them.  We had four different servers at one point and before any of them could get to our table to take our order, the barkeep came by since we had been sitting (unattended to) for about twenty minutes. This could have definitely had to do with the fact that for a while we were the only ones inside the dining area, but the servers never acknowledged the crap service.  A simple, ""Sorry 'bout the wait"" would have sufficed.  Oh well.

Luckily for us, this only took about 15 minutes, in which we had enough time to sample some of their tasty sake.

Our chef was absolutely hilarious! He had a sort of Bruce Lee trying to do a joke type of humour and was a magician with his utensils. My colleague went for the scallops, while I opted for the filet mignon. Both were very tasty but the chef mentioned that I should try the samurai steak next time, as it's his personal favourite (he let me have a little bite and it was delicious).

I agree with another reviewer, if you're in a rush, it's not the place for you. And it is awkward to sit with a bunch of people you don't know. However, more often than not, my fianc  and I are seated at a table alone which is nice. 

Considering the portions, this place isn't that expensive. It is one of the only restaurants where my fianc  doesn't need to eat a second meal 30 minutes later. Our bill (with tax but no tip) usually comes out to $115. This includes a bottle of sake (I order the chicken teriyaki, he orders the shrimp and filet mignon).  

In terms of the ""show"" aspect, I'm not a huge fan of this. I have only experienced chefs who really put on a show when dining with large groups. But this, for me, is a positive.

It has the same concept as Yorkdale and Eaton Centre, as they give you real cutlery and dishes as opposed to the plastic ones.  

Compared to Eaton Centre, and Yorkdale, this is a lot smaller, but there is still at least 20 places to choose from including some of the newer entries into the food court wars (Big Smoke Burger, Amaya Express, SU&SHI, Shanghai 360, Chipolte, Szechuan Express) plus the older ones (A&W, KFC, Manchu Work etc.).

Overall, it's not a bad place to eat if you are on your lunch, can't decide what to eat or are just hanging out at the mall, but not worth a special drive (it is a food court after all right?)

Good:  Use of actual stainless steal cutlery, melamine trays, bowls, cute condiment containers, cups, etc.  Newly renovated eateries, washrooms, seating. 

Bad:  Not enough seating, especially at peak times, considering the amount of eateries, and there aren't any visible garbage/recycling bins, so as a diner, you can either leave your tray/trash on the tables OR bring your tray to the station to have someone else clean up after you.  :(

This is not a good message to insinuate to shoppers.  Instead, I think Food Central should promote a more community-like attitude such as ""please clean up after yourself"" and set up different bins - similar to IKEA/Whole Foods - so that everyone can do their part!

I worked at Square One for several years back when I was in university and remember the food court quite well...it was my savior on the (many) occasions that I would forget to bring my lunch to work. How I didn't pack on twenty pounds at the time is beyond me. It was adequate back then, if pretty standard. Now with a lot of malls stepping up their game, it's nice to see that Square One has followed suit.

Everything has been redone and renovated and it has a nice and modern look, although it does look a little cold and sterile compared with how it used to. Lots of new places as well as the old, so there really is a good selection. It's still overpriced and often dull mall food but at least you have options. They've also made the switch to reusable cutlery and dishware, which is obviously great.

i had fairly high hopes for this place based on the yelp reviews id perused so i was very let down when it turned out that i had been mislead ...

first of all the good : the decor , if trying a little too hard to create a ""fine-dining"" type of atmosphere , is pleasant and i really liked the artwork on the walls featuring the nepalese (or indian ?) countryside .  the music was also nice traditional indian music .  the servers were very pleasant ; they kept their distance and didnt offer much banter but were kind , polite and attentive .

the bad :  THE FOOD !  after waiting quite a while in an empty restaurant to receive our order , we thought that maybe this was a good sign as some of our meal was being prepared ""fresh"" .  sadly this was not the case except maybe for the bindi masala which was slimy and undercooked .  the aloo gobi featured very hard cauliflower and stale tasting , dried out potatoes .  most disappointing was the butter chicken which was VERY tough and dry .  the sauce was not rich at all - definitely couldnt detect any butter and very little cream .  the tomatoes didnt lend any sweetness as they should but instead made the dish quite bitter .

the naan was okay .

if we hadnt had a discount through groupon , it would have felt like a complete rip-off .  the potions were VERY tiny and all four members of our party left very dissatisfied .

no offence to the other reviewers but im wondering if maybe the higher rating is partly due to the large student population in the area ; maybe this place is earning high praise from people who have little experience with indian food or what torontos competitive dining scene really has to offer ?",0,2,0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w,review,1

Typically, Indian restaurants dry the crap out of their chicken when they put it in the tandoor, and this is the strongest point in favour of this restaurant getting 4 stars.

They've clearly put in effort to make the place not look as tacky as the proverbial south asian restaurant, and for that I commend them. 

The food is not bad per se, but it's pretty generic and forgettable. The Nepali portion of the menu is limited, and unfortunately the differences between the Indian and Nepali dishes were very minimal, for eg,: our server told us that the only difference between Bhuteko Cauli (Nepali Entree) and Aloo Ghobi (Indian Entree) was that the latter had potatoes in it! I understand that Nepali dishes aren't that different but to make the dishes taste the same is a bit ridiculous. They think that since no single table is going to order both the Nepali and Indian equivalents together, they can get away with making cosmetic changes to their dishes.

We ordered  Keema Samosas,  and the Nepalese Entrees: Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, lentils and bamboo shoots) and Khasi Ko Masu (goat meat with bone) and Ras Malai for dessert. The food was freshly prepared and piping hot. The Aloo Tama Bodi was quite bland and the Goat Meat curry tasted like generic Indian  goat curry. I was quite interested in the Aloo Tama Bodi primarily for the bamboo shoots and was saddened to see limp, noodl-y shoots in the bowl. Oh well. However, the Ras Malai was very good: delicately sweet, milky and cool.

There were two meat dished, a few vegetarian dishes, and a small salad bar, so there was some variety, but the quality left a lot to be desired. The meat dishes were dry and cooked carelessly - the pieces of chicken looked like they'd been hacked at - and the veggies at the salad bar were dry and looked rather waxy. The only good dishes were the vegetarian ones, and while they tasted okay, it didn't feel like much care had been taken in their preparation.

""Last week I wrote a review for Mt. Everest Restaurant expressing mixed opinions on Mt Everest: high quality food but at the cost of poor service (Refer to bottom of this review).  Within a matter of days, I was surprised to have received an extremely apologetic response via Yelp from the owners of Mt. Everest Restaurant.  They apologized for the inconvenience they may have caused my party, informed me that the staff was briefed about the situation and that new staff has been consequently hired, and offered me a coupon for my friends and me.  

Although I have yet to go back (I'm pretty sure I would despite the disappointing service I faced the second time I went), I have decided to up the rating for the restaurant because I am entirely impressed by the fact that the restaurant owners are both concerned with and responsive to the opinions of their customers.""

I went back with a group of five friends to Mt. Everest after claiming the coupon.  As they had promised, the service was much improved--the service was fast and the meal was as expected delicious. I'm pretty sure they were unaware that I had previously complained on yelp about their terrible service, so I'm hoping that my experience was unbiased. With their improved service and same excellent quality of food, I am changing my review to five stars.

We never manage to spend under $50, which is a shame since I'd like to incorporate this restaurant into daily life.

Okra is my favourite vegetable when it comes to Indian cuisine and I order it whenever I can. Mt Everest's bhindi masala over some uninspired rice left me satisfied (it's actually way better as reheated leftovers) and I enjoyed the nice spicy kick to it, but the garlic naan was flat out disappointing. I'm a bit of a garlic naan connoisseur and I am not quite sure what to even say about what I tried because there was not much to it. It wasn't garlicky in the slightest, not even buttery, and the naan's texture was dry, tasteless, and chewy in an unflattering way.

I am for sure willing to give Mt Everest a second shot because I walk past it all the time and would really like to try some of their other items, but first I need to recover from this meal that cost over $30 (two entrees, rice, and naan - really?) and a bit of an upset stomach.",1,3,0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w,review,2

I ordered butter chicken, naan and drinks. The delivery was done in 30 minutes which is very good when compared to delivery times of other Indian restaurants. 

The food:

1. Butter Chicken: Delivery quantity was very small when compared to the actual dine-in quantity. The chicken tasted as if it was just put into the butter chicken gravy and served. We wouldn't have cared much if only the gravy tasted good. Being an Indian, I can easily differentiate good butter chicken from the rest. Unfortunately, this wasn't the best I have had in Toronto.

I had enough and said- look, either we sit asap or we can leave, to which he replied - not possible today...human error... I'd be happy to serve you another day...we waited for him to add the words 'on the house' or at least a measly 'at a discount' but NO! nothing...he just looked at us blankly.

we ordered the Non-Vegetarian Bhojan for two and to start we ordered the chicken momos.  so we had a mixture of indian and nepalese food.   the momos were absolutely deeeelicious.  they dough was cooked well (maybe slightly overdone, but if so just barely) so that it was soft and not overly chewy.  the filling inside was tender pieces of chicken and spinach i think.  that was very tangy, like it had soup inside or something.

then the waiter brought us one part of a our Bhojan.  that had a couple different kinds of chicken, like the tandoori, some boti kebab - which might have been beef or lamb, not sure.  the chicken was surprisingly tender and tasty in both forms.  the lamb/beef both in its form here and in the lamb curry to follow were overdone and too chewy, too rubbery.  what was to follow was the lamb curry, the mutter paneer, a raita and a couple of rice puddings for desert.

the sauces were pretty great, the accompanying veggies (though not substantial) were tasty, as they had absorbed the juices and accompanying sauces and spices of the meats.

What we ordered:
Momos
Jhane ko dal
Aloo tama bodi
Lamb Briyani
Raita

When asked how hot - we selected medium. Im not a fan of super hot - I much prefer deep rich flavour. We were assured that medium would be the right selection (mild - too bland, and hot would have too much heat). They were right. The medium was perfect - deep rich flavours and just a hint of warmth which is perfect on a cold day.

The food itself was cooked to perfection. The lamb was cooked enough to be ""cooked"" but still melt in your mouth soft.   Aloo tami bodi was a potato dish with bamboo and black-eyed peas in a rich yummy sauce. The momos came with a lentil mustard sauce that my companion ate with a spoon (it was that good).

Even with many alcoholic drinks the final tally was quite inexpensive! Which is rare for a unique dining experience downtown.

I had made it my mission that the first Indian restaurant she tried would have to be the best if I wanted to make a convert of her- and I was only going to get one chance at it... thankfully the server picked up on that and made some suggestions and was very kind explaining to her the signature dishes there.

The Sitar player is quite good, but loud. Watch where they seat you, he may just be on break and then when the party gets started up again, boy are you in for a ear-ful.

Based on the positive reviews here for Mt Everest, and being that I've never had Nepalese food before, I pushed to give it a try. We only ordered some garlic naan, plain rice, and two entrees:

1. Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, bamboo shoots, and black beans in mountain spices)
2. Malai Kofta (Cottage Cheese with vegetables in a cashew sauce)

The dishes were both tasty! I really enjoyed the Aloo Tama Bodi's flavour, and the Malai Kofta was also delicious.

Additionally, I was happy with the amount of Naan and rice we received in a single order. There was more than enough to cover both dishes. The ratio of bread or rice needed to cover a dish at Mt Everest is clearly 1:1.

Which brings me to why my review is only 2 star. The portions! First of all, the Malai Kofta only came with about 3 small cubes of cheese. Both dishes came in small, unfilled containers (sadly Instagram deleted our photo evidence) and compared to Indian portions elsewhere (and the price) we were disappointed.

I kind of liked the balance here. Nothing was overdone. Everything was savory and satisfying. It made for a very pleasant meal. And that's something to celebrate.",19,4,0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w,review,14

Limiting my meat intake has brought me to fully appreciate a place that does meat justice. And justice Mt. Everest does.

I've sampled a few items here and there on the menu, but I feel like it's hard to go wrong. Tikka masala tends to be a crowd pleaser, and I'd recommend the appetizer plate if you want to sample. Don't both with rice or dessert, though you may want naan to compensate for the spice. And again, although I try to be veg most times, I would say abandon any such intentions here and embrace the perfect succulence that is their meat dishes. 

Not a five though because it's a bit pricey yet fails to pull off the classy act (though it does try. E for effort?). Servers also tend to be a bit rude, which I can only ignore when prices are low enough to make me feel like I'm getting away with something.

Located on the northern side of Bell Road in a newer strip mall the outside looks very inviting.  As you walk in the decor is neatly situated and the atmosphere gets you excited for some possible good mexican food.  After your initial look around when walking in a little confusion may settle in. No one will greet you at the door and you wonder if you should wait to be sat or just seat yourself.  With more observation you'll notice a sign far away from the front door saying ""Please seat yourself.""  

So you look for a clean cozy table and seat yourself, which is not a big deal at all.  Next you have to wait for someone to give you a menu to see what they actually serve.  You would think that menus would arrive very shortly, but I found out that on two occasions it took upwards to five minutes for them to arrive.  I am an understanding person , I can see the place is busy,and I love mexican food so I patiently wait with a smile.

I could go and on about how long it took for my experiences here.  What I found out on two lunch visits that the owners are the servers as well.  No problem at all with this if you are good at what you do and are speedy.  However when each server has over a ten table section and can't get you in and out in a timely manner then it's time to hire some help.  Or maybe change your concept of the restaurant while having customers go to a window and order their food.

I'll remind you that the food is really good, but everything takes forever.  My recommendation is to try takeout.",0,3,29XtLRA0y7Nfi4eZF-ZI4A,review,0

This is Halisco style food - not the same! Think of it as more of a gourmet style Mexican restaurant. And b) they ordered the chicken tacos. Admittedly, they sort of suck. I've been coming here with my family for years! After they moved across town to the new location, we followed.

When I walked in the door the first room was completely empty and there was a woman standing and staring at me. I turned to look at the sign and turned back around. She still said nothing. I asked if they were open and she said what did the sign say? I said it says open (but why the hell are you just staring at me like you are not). She finally says there is a large party coming in and to sit in the other room. I said sure. Both rooms are fairly small. The decor is pretty whack. Old office looking carpet and old booths. I'm a fan of tile in restaurants. Spilled food and drinks just don't come out of carpet and especially old office looking carpet. The tables are covered with that cheap vinyl red sticky covers that also never look or feel clean. The benches were old and had tears in them. There were 3 gentlemen in another booth and other than that the place was empty. 

We were brought menus and drinks fairly quickly but no salsa. Another couple came in and sat down after us and were given chips and salsa immediately. Our waitress came back and asked if were ready to order. Still no chips and salsa. About 15 minutes into our ""quick"" lunch we were finally given a small bowl of chips and a couple of salsa. The salsa was ok. Nothing special. Same for the chips. We placed our orders and in comes out in about another 10-15 minutes. 

I had the El Conquistador burrito. Its a pretty large burro filled with a chile relleno, steak picado, and guac. It was ok. Really nothing good or bad. For 7.50 I expect greatness in a burrito. The wife had a bean and cheese burro w/ enchilada sauce. They were very tight on the sauce and cheese. It was the overall theme of the place. Very tight. For extra chips and salsa it was 1.50 according to the menu. 

The waitress came by another 15-20 minutes later and asked how we were. I said we were ready to go now. She didn't take our plates and she didn't bring our bill. Another 5-10 minutes goes by and I finally get up and walk to the man at the front and ask him if could pay him directly. Our waitress, who's now talking on the phone, with our dirty plates still on our tables and check no where to be found even after I asked for it, makes a statement to the man that I am ready to go. No b, I was ready to go 20 minutes ago when I told you I was done. Now I'm ready for an apron cause I've been here long enough to get paid. 

From the conversations I heard the man and woman own the place. Good for them. I wont be back and don't recommend anyone else going back.

Very conflicted feelings.

I have gone here a few times when they were located on 32nd and Greenway. Every experience was a little different.

-Sometimes the service was good. Maybe it depends on their mood. When it was good it was usually the wife who was our server. She kind of reminded me of one my aunts. Warm, slightly teasing, calling us ""bambinos"". 
- I have always liked the food. I have had the chili relleno and enchiladas entrees. Both were a solid 7 out of 10. The beans are very tasty too.

The bad-
- When the service was bad it was usually the husband. Not friendly. Slow. Wouldn't refill our waters and soft drinks. Yet seemed attentive and talkative to other tables. Made us feel like total crap.
- Slightly overpriced.
- Charged for extra chips and salsa.
- My husband didn't like the food.
- Probably my worst experience was when I called at lunchtime to place a to go order. She said they couldn't take the order because they had a huge table of people. Just flat out refused. Guess what I wanted? Just a bean burrito! It takes 30 seconds to make.

4eHcfli7mBNrC3NsvPii-g,8bKpyXdiYF3ZKIB3QyEiVQ,2010-10-07,1,"I was new to Toronto when I visited Local 4 a few months ago.  They were on my radar of places to check out due to a reputation for craft beers and good food that I'd heard through a friend -- and, when they popped up as a Groupon, I jumped.  The menu and beerlist on their website really sealed the deal.

I invited a couple other friends who had never been to come along, one of whom is a picky eater (and, after looking at the site, was excited), the other of whom, like me, is always looking to try new beers.

So we get to Local 4...  and it's a huge let down.

The food was mediocre to bad.  

I had the bison spaghetti bolognese, which tasted as though they forgot to salt the water when cooking the noodles.  The sauce was ok, but there was precious little of it.  When I order a pasta dish at a restaurant and it's $14, I expect it to be something more than I can prep, at home, with little effort.  I wouldn't have been ashamed to serve it myself, but I certainly wouldn't have expected any particular compliments after the fact.

Steak & Frites went to one friend, who's experience was similar to others here:  steak was dry, tough, bad.

Other friend had the chicken cordon bleu -- she finished the chicken, which was decent (but again, nothing special), then left the potatoes and vegetables as unpalatable.  I was incredulous, so tried a few...  and she was right.

But the kicker was the beer list or, more appropriately, the lack of one.  They didn't have a single one of the craft beers we specifically came to try -- we ended up ordering some Blanche de Chambley (a personal fave, but not one I was hoping to ""try""), then stuck with cocktails.  They didn't have MacAuslan (either apricot or stout), Black Oak, or Stonehammer (dark or light).  Are you kidding me?  You're touting your craft beers, and your selections are mostly imports, Sleemans, and a cider?  And what you do have are the most common, usual suspects: Mill St, Steamwhistle, and the like?  

We were bummed.  Add to this that the server had a rather uncaring attitude, was slow, and, when presenting the bill, just dumped it on the table.  Even forgot to factor in the Groupon, and seemed annoyed that I wanted him to adjust it.  (Now I feel like I'm ragging on the guy -- he seemed like a cool guy, just kind of out of his depth.)

In any case, I would hesitate giving a 1* rating to Local 4 if only because there's great potential there:  nice ambience, cool location, a menu that looks good on paper...  but they need to seriously re-evaluate what they're doing and their approach to food, drink, and service.

ug5w2Ui7dqZhuv-UlzTKwQ,HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,2012-03-28,0,"Pallucci is a quaint Italian restaurant located in the Mount Pleasant/Davisville area.  If you weren't a local, you probably wouldn't know it was here.  The decor is simple but modern and the servers are all very friendly.  The main colours of the restaurant are blue and red and the lighting creates a great ambiance, with lit candles lining the rear wall.  Upstairs houses 2 of its private dining areas which accommodate groups of 20-50 guests.     There is plenty of free street parking nearby - just one of the perks of being away from restaurants in the downtown core.

The menu has a good selection of Italian dishes.  I did fell however, that the entr es list was a bit small - especially if you weren't really up for pizza or pasta.

The house wine was courtesy of House Wine Co. featuring both the Red House (a blend of Shiraz and Cabarnet) and the White House (a blend of Riesling and Pinot Grigio).  These are both wines from the Niagara region, and I highly recommend them.  The server was even kind enough to bring over the bottle so we knew what it looked like before we head to the LCBO.  Wine purists may be scoffing at me, but I like hybrids!

The starter bread basket was warm, and probably one of the better breads I've had in Toronto.  For starters, it was warm.  It got a sprinkling of salted herbs and a dousing of balsamic vinegar.  It was hard not to devour the entire thing.  The bread was perfectly crusty as if it were fresh out of the oven.

We opted to share a Spinach Salad ($10) which was tossed with a halved egg, cherry tomatoes, red onion and shaved Parmesan cheese.  I found the leaves to have been awkwardly big, and the salad itself was pretty bland.  The saving grace were the freshly toasted walnuts.

For mains I opted for the meat special, a Peppercorn Striploin served with a generous portion of sweet potato fries (which I substituted in place of regular fries).  I loved that Chef Neil Siomra placed the steak on top of the bed of fries as the jus just trickled down and gave the fries great flavour.  The steak was cooked to my requested medium-rare, but unfortunately a bit lacking in the seasoning department.  The meat itself had no real flavour and relied heavily on the peppercorn sauce to spruce it up.  The sweet potato fries were absolutely divine, not too oily, and thin-cut just the way I like them.  I'd come here just to have these again.

My dining companion opted for the pasta special which was a Snow Crab Ravioli topped with grilled shrimp. The tomato sauce was very fresh.  I would've preferred if the ravioli were cooked just a tad more.  The crab was virtually absent or drowned out by the rich cheese filling as I couldn't discern any of the lumpy meat while eating this dish.

To finish off the evening we opted to share the Raspberry & Chocolate Tartufo ($7).  While it took awhile for the actual dessert to show up, it was well worth the wait.   The thin shell had a great texture to it - it reminded me of an Italian mochi with its slightly elastic exterior that was lightly dusted with cocoa powder.  The interior filling was dense and rich, with a raspberry centre.

Verdict:

The staff at Pallucci make you feel like you're in nana's house.  They're warm, and serve you with a smile.  They were always around if you needed something, and quick to remove your plates when you've finished.  I must also thank Chef Siomra for bringing us 2 separate plates of salad even though we were sharing.

The food here doesn't leave you feeling heavy, and is very fresh.  With that said, the food could benefit from a bit of flavour development.",0,3,111d13yLgIdqvpZekgVnbQ,review,0

Chelsea was our server and she was sweet as can be but perhaps a tad bit on the ditzy side.

It's an older crowd at Barcelona than, say, whatever club on Mill Avenue in Tempe. But that's not to say they are grown-ups. In fact, it is a lot more like high school than anything else. The uncool cool people prance around while spiced up oldies make communicating with anything other than hand gestures and swirling hips worthless. The black-suited security guards talking into their sleeves every few seconds also offer a real --- if not short-lived and ultimately comical --- feel that this place is actually hip. 

In a word: Underwhelming.

Make no mistake about it, though, Barcelona is beautifully appointed. Leather chairs and sofas make for comfy private lounges for the lucky (or wealthy) few who occupy them. The sprawling patio is an excellent place on a late summer evening in Arizona. Multiple bars make for relatively speedy service. And the overall gargantuan size of the place makes the crowd seem less, well, crowded.

Ok, all that said, I've been reading on Yelp about all the ""cougars"" who frequent this lovely establishment. I define a ""cougar"" not by age, but as a woman who knows what she wants (me). So my buddy, who's also a man about town and similarly successful in this field, and I decide that this is our new watering hole. We've been there twice in the last two weeks. Guess how many woman we've taken home or who have taken us to their homes in the last two weeks? Four. Guess how many we've given The Business to... The same four. Guess what our batting average is... .1000

Usually, I need to take a woman out one more time before The Business is exchanged. Sometimes more if she's particularly prudish. Barcelona is where The Business is the understood currency. I like The Business. So if you're reading this and you think I'm scum, I used to be you. I've ""evolved."" If you're reading this and you're a woman who knows what she wants, shoot me a message. And if you're reading this you think I'm lying because you didn't get laid last time you went there, I am willing to show you how. But you'd never take my advice because you don't believe me or think you'll succeed next time on your own or think I'm an ass for writing this and you don't want to meet me on principle. I don't blame you. I feel dirty. But just a little. Mostly smug.",8,5,4P1h3LKaCkgQL5dSy5d9gw,review,16

I have often wondered if every bar has too many men, there must be one place where all of the women go. Where is that place? That question was once rhetorical. It turns out, in Scottsdale, Arizona, that place is Barcelona's. 

We were seated early in the section that is cleared out to make way for a dance floor as later in the night Zooey Boey takes the stage. We started with a few appetizers, of which my clear favorite was the macadamia nut encrusted shrimp; they were incredibly good (I do not even like macadamia nuts). The portions were more than generous for each person at the table. I had the bone-in-ribeye which came with a Bearnaise sauce on the side that was very good. They serve a molten chocolate desert that was heavenly on a soft bed of ice cream. We all left extremely full and even more satisfied with the meal.

Given it being a Thursday, the place was packed.  Best way to describe this place is amazing Spanish decor on a large scale.  The outdoor patio is perfect for warm days/nights and the interior is typical of Scottsdale architecture: new, modern with airplane hanger height ceilings and furnished with beautiful furniture and warm tones.

Dare I say it?  It's actually better than places in S.F.  *sniff*

I expected country bumpkins (Sorry!  My first time in Phoenix.  Had to trudge over for work.) but found a Laguna Beach/Costa Mesa atmosphere (sans the ocean) in the middle of the desert.

I heard Brittany and Jess head to this place when they're in town...but you may/may not want to disclose that info.

The only drawback to the Scottsdale/Phoenix scene is the distance between one venue to the next.

It is spacious, so for all the claustrophobic people out there, you'll definitely not feel like a sardine in a tin can. I love how you have your options open - if you'd like to feel the sultry summer breeze, or lack of, you can sit outside, or if you are freezing you can go to the main building, and dance your drunk ass off. Yes, the live band's slightly cheesy, but when you're inebriated, who cares? 

Caution, for cougar lovers, there are a lot prowling around, waiting to sink their claws in young meat. I've never had the opportunity to eat there, so I can't say anything in regards to food. This is definitely not for people who are going out, expecting to meet a ton of young people, and surround yourself with recent college graduates. Yes, there is diversity. I've seen young to extremely old. I've met my share of extremely weird characters, like this man who was trying to pull girls from the dance floor or the bar, to share the VIP experience with his son who was celebrating his birthday. It sort of felt like he was trying to pimp us out to his son, but that's a different story all together. 

Barcelona's is a cougar's den, and the drinks aren't satisfactory for the wallet, but I do emphasize how I love the spaciousness of this place! I suppose that's the only reason I enjoy it, anyway.

What can't I say about this place that hasn't been said before?

Food:  they have a new chef, so apparently they heard others talking badly about the food.  I actually really enjoyed the food and our server was awesome.  Ridiculously expensive?  Yes.  Good to my tum?  Definitely.  We decided to try a little of everything so in our menu was the Seared Ahi, Chopped salad with bacon dates, Tenderloin empanadas, Mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes, and sweet potato fries.

Ahi was seared perfectly.  It had a slightly spicey musky sauce with it.  Very yum unless you don't like raw-ish fish.  Bacon dates are my new favorite.  Mmmm.  Empanadas were good, but you didn't really get much of a meat flavor.  Caprese was wonderfully fresh.  Sweet potato fries....god yes.

Price per dish around $9 to $14.  You're looking at about $25 for an entree.  Drinks were relatively decent in price...but $12 for a glass of wine.  My favorite Reisling is $12 per bottle, for crying out loud.

This place is AWESOME for people watching.  Young things with massive...melons of flesh, meat-head men trying to look cool, 50+ women trying to outdo the young things, and 50+ men ogling everyone creepily.

The singers on stage were quite cheesy.  Great choice in music, but I'd much rather listen to the DJ version than a upscale karaoke.  No dude, you're NOT bringing sexy back with those aviator shades and check shirt.  And whoa...the female singer...honey, you need someone else to do your extentions.

Wierd mix of dress code:  from prom date to stained t-shirts.  Ugh.

$9 for a pack of cigs (I don't smoke, but I heard) and you can order a drink in the bathroom.  Wha?  So you can drink and pee all night long and never have to leave the room?

It just wasn't that good, and the room was so dark that it was hard to see what I was eating. The shoestring fries side were a pleasant surprise - a giant mound of crispy potato.

This so called high end restaurant had some stuck up hostess and waitress. I ordered a steak medium rare, I was given a burnt piece of meat. I ordered lobster bisque and was given sloppy with butter in my soup and it was the saltiest thing I've ever eaten. This place can't do food or entertainment. The entertainment was called Envy. What a joke! They can't sign but apparently every overly tanned person in Arizona think they are wonderful. No accounting for taste. If you go to Scottsdale, take a pass on this place...its overpriced. What they spent on pretty building they should have spent on training staff and getting an actual DJ!

1.  Cougars on the prowl - lots of hot, old women who are on the prowl for younger guys....they are full of botox and silicone.  I guess this isn't always a negative, as it does help boost ones ego, but sometimes the way that they are desperate is sort of lame.

2.  BBQ - If you're sitting outside on the patio, prepare to smell like BBQ chicken after you are done.  I don't know who designed this, but it was pretty poor engineering.  You don't build a BBQ in the middle of the lounge, so that your patrons get smoke in their faces.

3.  Fancy Cars - Sure I love Ferrari's just as much as the next guy, but the fact that they put them in the front is sort of lame....like they're trying too hard to make themselves look uber-cool.

4.  Lounge singers - they have had the same lounge singers, singing the same songs for years.  I thought that the girl was hot, but she's more of a Monet (good from afar, but all messed up when looking up close)

It actually is a restaurant, too. The food is Ok. The Paella is huge and not bad. They try real hard to make this place the chi-chi joint for the hip resort/snowbird crowd. It is huge, with several dining areas and bars, a large patio, and a small stage and decent dance floor. They usually have live music on the weekends and intersperse with Disco DJs. On weekends you have cowgirls walking around with their ""shooters"" holsters and shot glasses thru the 4 bars. A lot of the waitresses (not just here, but in most of Snotsdale's higher end joints) are part time ASU coeds trying to make a buck to buy more short skirts and halter tops at the mall. 

Everyone at night is pretty much trying to create an impression beyond their true reality, whether it is the young diggers or the old farts. If you are from Dallas or Calgary, you will probably like this place for its unapologetic panash for conspicouus consumption.

The decor is sketchy, to say the least.  When we got there (just after 7pm) we were the only people there.  Paper place mats, folded paper menus, not necessarily the cleanest cutlery I've ever seen.  Service was poor.  The waitress didn't know the menu AT ALL, and was not so attentive.

Not the best prices, either.  $4 for veggie pakora appetizers, $10.50 for my channa masala and $11 for his chicken tikka masala, $3.50 for naan to share.

The food was pretty awesome.  The pakoras were delicious, and there was a big plate of them.  The chutneys were really good as well.  The entrees were spicy, but not overwhelming.  Very tasty!!  The rice was perfectly cooked, which makes such a big difference.  The garlic naan was definitely the stand-out dish.  Buttery and very garlicky and had a great texture to it.  I would go back and eat just that any time.

  Given a table and a chilled bottle of water I got started.. Two rows of food with an additional row containing some yogurt rice, watermelon, sauces/dressings and some meh looking fruit pudding.. Needless to say I kept focused on the main two rows.

  As I feasted on several platefuls of delicious goat roganjosh, spicy 'chicken 65' - sometimes with the butter chicken sauce on top, and some excellent chicken tandoori I was pleased to notice several large Indian families come in to eat - aaalways a good sign. Some more highlights include their great egg curry with glazed onions and mango dahl... 

  The recipes carry an authenticity to them... 4/5 stars - Recommended for anyone in the area looking to get some Indian food for lunch.

My kids like the Tandoori chicken. They have melons/fruits for dessert, too, so the kids like that, as well. And the naan--well, the naan--what can you say about naan? mmmmmm. Naan is a type of Indian bread, in case you've not had it. and it's fantastic here. Waaay too much carbs when you eat here!!  

I asked about the samosas--I have never been able to find small samosas since living in the middle east where they had Indians and Pakistanis on the streets with carts selling samosas (the small ones). I finally asked, and the guy told me they are a specialty item and hard to get. The big ones are easy to get. I don't care for the big ones.

The downfall to this place--the service isn't the best here. If you order water, they don't keep your glass full, and sometimes it tastes bad and you have to ask for a fresh glass of water. AND, they never know how much the kids are supposed to cost for the buffet. There's no sign for prices,and when you ask, you get a different answer each time!  A few times they didn't charge us for the 1-yr olds' buffet, and the last time we went, we were charged for both kids. I said, I thought he was free (indicating my 1yr old) and the kid serving us got the manager, who was an American female (no Indians to be found manning the floor) and she said there was a charge for each person's meal.

Yelp hasn't led me wrong yet...but anyways, I had wanted to try Matka, was starting to see the reviews and thought oh it's time to check this place out! When I suggested it he said yea sounds good.  That right their gave him some points, cuz it's normally my girlfriends that I talk into going with me to try new ethnic cuisines.

So got their around 6:30pm, Date looked cute & fly! We walked inside and saw we were one of the 1st people there, the owner, who was present was very friendly and helpful with everything. The place is very cute on the inside; I think we were early, because we had decided on trying out the dinner buffet to try a little bit of everything, and the owner asked us to give him a few mins to get all the serving spoons out. No problem we stayed at our table and sat and talked,  then owner said its ready! Oh yea baby I was starving and ready to go!

I tried a cauliflower dish, don't know what it was called but god it was good! Spicy, smoky and just delish, had a potato dish too, think its called aloo methi? Man that too was packed with little bit of heat, but not in a bad way, those 2 dishes might even get me to be a vegetarian for maybe a hour or so, um maybe not because I then spotted the butter chicken in that creamy orange sauce and the chili chicken with big slices of jalapenos and though who can live on veggie alone! Both the butter chicken and chili chicken are white meat and so very delish, also had some of the vegetable biryani and nana bread too.  Meal and Date were perfect! It was a good night!

Had the Palak Chicken which was good flavor, green sauce with spinach.  We also ordered Poori bread, which had big bubbles that were fun to poke at.  Since it was fried, the kids loved the crunchy top.  Hubby had the Lamb Vindaloo which was spicy and really good flavor, red sauce with lots of good spice.  The food is a little spicy, but we like spicy!  One downer is that I had to keep asking for a water refill, instead of them automatically checking in on us.

Also had the sugarcane drink but it tasted bland, like it was poured out of a can or a gallon, not at all fresh.

There was only 1 other family dining, so clearly they weren't swamped.  
There were many dishes which included South Indian and North India.  The paneer was just not right, too much tomato sauce and store bought paneer doesn't amount to great tasting butter paneer.  The chicken dishes were average to below average.  The dessert was horrible - runny mango custard, tasteless fried sweet bread.

There was zero ambience.  It was very 'store like'. I wish all the restaurants around could take a cue or two from 'Chutneys' in Tempe.  They have excellent tasting food, great ambience (because they actually employed an interior designer to do up their restaurant) and great prices.  Their flavors are unmatched.

Cons:
a. The chef needs to know that Indian food needs salt . Food tastes like Indian hospital food if theresn't any salt.  I heard another person complain as well when I entered.. So am not alone.
b. When this restaurant had a different owner , I thought I saw better ambiance inside.. Right now there is a mirror that is about it.. Just plain walls everywhere.. Booths did look very small and we didn't try it anyways. Interestingly , there was no music either ..
c. Sambar is supposed to be a mix of Tamarind water, spices, Dal and vegetables like onion. In here only the first ingredient was present.
d. When we entered , the Naan tray was empty. When I tried twice later on, they were empty. When I left , they were empty. The owner or manager was right there. But there wasnt sufficient Naan at all. I left without even having an opportunity to taste Naan. My wife who was fortunate to get one piece said it was good.
c. Andhra Chicken was ok and so was the egg curry. Butter chicken tasted very dry and with no spice.
d. What is up with the vegetarian choices - egg plant curry and zucchini curry.. Can u not come up with better choices for Sunday buffet?
e. The served bottle water which was good but food should be good too which was absent.
f. I thought the menu said vegetable biryani. I only saw colored rice. Didnt taste like Biryani.
g. Food felt fresh as the website claimed . Only the chef needs to learn to cook better.
h. I wouldnt go there for dinner . The owner needs to add some interiors to this restaurant otherwise it would compete only with the C-Fu next door instead of being a restaurant for dinner.

Their main dishes like Pad Thai and other noodles and rice dishes are just okay... too much sauce or weird sauce flavour....I ordered stir fry veggies and it was practically raw, the sauce they used was kinda gross, so I didn't even eat the dish.

Both the Coconut Soup and Tom Yum Soup were really tasty, especially the Coconut soup which tasted good without being creamy. The Tom Yum is on the sour side, but my Yoga classmate seemed to enjoy that. 

Green Curry Chicken which suppose to be 3 chili spicy lack the spiciness, but I was surprised with all the veggie and the use of white meat in the dish. 

Pad Thai... stay away from Pad Thai.... the only thing is good about it is at least Phuket Paradise didn't use ketchup. But the Tamarind sauce they used tasted blend and the dish is kind of lukewarm not hot from the wok!

I had a Thai Coconut infused seafood soup. It came quickly, was nice and hot and had a nice balance of flavour. This is at the core of Thai food, that blend of tastes with the lemon grass assertively tweaking the mix.

As an appetizer, we indulged in the cold rice paper rolls. The dip was very tasty, hut the rolls fell flat. They had an unexciting melange of vegetsbles with cellophane noodles, and not the usual shrimps. I regretted not listening to my wifenas she urged me not to order 2 serving of the appetizer.

It's very obvious that this place is Chinese run, given that they don't realize how funny their name can be, and that they have many Chinese dishes on their menu. Even their receipts have Chinese printings. That should raise some flags in your mind about how authentic this place is. But being the only choice for Thai food in the area, you don't really have a choice. After my first visit, I don't think this place is all bad. Some dishes were a hit and some were a miss.

We ordered a Thai combo for 4 for take out. They said the food will be ready in 10 minutes and they weren't kidding. I arrived about 10 minutes after I placed the call and the food was ready and packaged and sitting on the counter. We took the food home to eat and it pretty much confirmed my suspicions on authenticity. I'll comment on each item.

Red Curry: Best dish of the night and tastes authentic. The dish is loaded with flavor and chicken pieces.

Phad thai chicken: I've had phad thai at many places and there seems to be a wide range of difference. PP's phad thai feels like Chinese stir-fry to me. It seems to be missing some key Thai ingredients. Too light on the fish sauce, not enough eggs, and I think they used onions instead of shallots. 

Basil Beef: I don't feel the basil. It kind of tastes like regular Chinese stir-fry beef with veggies with an added spiciness. Compared with the red curry, the there's a lot less meat in this dish. Not bad, but doesn't feel Thai enough.

Tamarind Shrimp: I never want to eat this dish again. This is not tamarind. This tastes like Chinese sweet and sour sauce, and not a very well made one.

Their prices aren't cheap, but not outrageously expensive either. The portion size is generous. I would come again, but I'm definitely going to stick with the curries. I suspect this place uses powders for some dishes. I don't see how they could have prepped my meal so quickly otherwise. I'm most disappointed by the Phad Thai and the Tamarind shrimp.

We ordered a steak, a prosciutto with melon platter, caprese salad, and a calamari. The calamari tasted phenomenal, as did the prosciutto. The steak was covered in gravy sauce, but the steak itself was not as good in flavor nor texture.
 ""Dinner for two"", which also included a soda, bottle of water, a tiramisu and cappuccino costed 72 , plus my voluntary tip. I probably wouldn't have tipped if I knew what was about to happen. (I always tip generously at restaurants, except when the waitstaff treats us cheaply.)
We overall enjoyed our experience at the table as a group until the end when the waiter tried to charge one of the couples in our group for additional items which they did not order. It seems as if somebody else's meal had not been paid and our friends were being pressured to pay it. During the meal, we were pleased and everyone thought it was a good place for special dinners, but after the problem with the check, we all changed our minds. 
The waiter had the audacity to tell one of the ladies in our group that paying it would not make you poor. 
He's right, but we're also not stupid. What an insult. So from a 4.5 star experience, with the 1 star treatment in the end, they get a very generous 3-star. (Only a sincere apology from the owner to our group would change my rating to 4.)",0,3,1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q,review,0

Die guten Bewertungen im Internet, welche das Restaurant als bestes in Sindelfingen darstellen, sind teilweise Gef lligkeitsbewertungen, wie sich schon am Schreibstil leicht feststellen l  t. Zudem sind 25 Bewertungen von Personen, welche nur eine einzige Bewertung ver ffentlich haben.
Doch der Reihe nach:
1. Besuch- Weihnachtsfeier unserer Firma- (ca. 25 Personen). Personal und K che total  berfordert. Getr nke liefern funktionierte sehr schleppend und bis das letzte Essen kam, waren  ber 3 Stunden vergangen. W hrend sich ein Teil der Kollegen unten auf der Kegelbahn vergn gte, sa en andere da und warteten und warteten und warteten. Dabei war angek ndigt, da  wir nach dem Essen gemeinsam die Kegelbahn nutzen wollen.
2.Besuch- abends mit 3 Personen- Gastst tte relativ leer, dadurch Bedienung in akzeptabler Zeit, allerdings das Essen nicht  berm  ig  ppig. Da ich meine Frau und einen Bekannten eingeladen hatte, empfahl ich eben noch einen Nachtisch zu nehmen. Jetzt zeigte sich etwas, was in anderen Bewertungen im Internet schon sehr h ufig beschrieben wurde, die famili re Atmosph re des Restaurants. Der Kellner setzte sich zu bekannten G sten an den Tisch. Der Rest des Lokals wurde ab dem Zeitpunkt ignoriert, was sowohl Speisen, als auch Getr nke betraf. Nach einer halben Stunde wurde es selbst dem Koch zuviel und er kam in die Gaststube, um den Kellner darauf hinzuweisen, da  seit 30 Minuten unser Tiramisu auf die Abholung wartet.
3.Besuch -2 Paare- Im Sommer mal wieder ein Besuch. Restaurant relativ gut gef llt und wir sa en auf der Terasse. Das man beim Bringen der Karte gleich die Getr nkebestellung aufnehmen kann, war dem Kellner unbekannt, daher auch diesmal wieder lange Wartezeiten auf Essen und Getr nke. Das Essen war nicht schlecht, aber so wenig, da  nicht einmal die beiden Frauem satt wurden. Unser Bekannter meinte dann auch zu seiner Angetrauten:""Eigentlich h tte ich gern mal bei Dir gekostet, aber als ich die paar St cken auf Deinem Teller gesehen habe, habe ich mich das nicht mehr getraut."". Diesmal haben wir es dem Kellner auch mitgeteilt, da  niemand satt ist. Er empfahl uns noch Bruschetta oder Pizzataschen zu nehmen, was wir auch taten (nat rlich auf Rechnung). Die anschlie enden Ramazotti nach dem Essen waren nat rlich br hwarm und der Getr nkenachschub wie immer schleppend. Wir waren allerdings gut gelaunt und wollten uns dies auch nicht verderben lassen, so nutzen wir die Zeit um mal mit zu stoppen, wie lange die anderen G ste so auf ihr Essen warten. Bei 2 jungen Burschen neben uns waren es anderthalb Stunden. Ein weiteres Paar fiel leider aus der Wertung, sie hatten zwar die Speisekarte erhalten, entschlossen sich aber nach ewiger Wartezeit auf die Bedienung zu gehen, daher mu ten wir sie leider disqualifizieren. Irgendwann haben wir  brigens angefangen, unsere 8 leeren Gl ser von Hefeweizen, Wein und Ramazotti am Tischrand in einer Reihe aufzustellen. Der Kellner verstand diesen ""dezenten"" Hinweis nicht. Das beim Kassieren das Weizenbier teurer war als ausgepreist, passte ins Bild.
4. Besuch-4 Kumpels- Ich wollte mit 3 Freunden und dem Zug in den Schwarzwald, also entschieden wir uns vor den 4 Stunden Zugfahrt noch eine Pizza zu essen. Es war Freitagmittag und die Gastst tte mittelpr chtig gef llt. Nachdem die Bedienung wieder auf sich warten lies, ging ein Freund zur Theke, um nachzufragen, ob wir in einer Stunde und 15 Minuten 4 Pizza haben k nnten. Dies war laut Kellner nicht m glich. PS. Im Eiscafe Firenze am ""Berliner Platz"", wo wir anschlie end hingingen, war dies trotz mittlerweile k rzerer Zeit kein Problem.

Da es keine Empfehlungen vom Haus gab, haben wir die sehr umfangreiche Standardkarte eines Italiener vorgenommen. Es wurde geessen: 1x Meeresfr chtesalat,  1 Spaghetti Carbonara, 1x Saltimbocca Romana, 1x Scaloppine pizzaliola, Dazu Mineralwasser, Pinot Grigio und Chianti.
Das Essen war au er dem Meeresfr chtesalat lecker aber nicht sehr viel.

Wir waren am vergangenen Samstag zum Abendessen da. Wir haben dieses Lokal aufgrund von Bewertungen ausgesucht. Wir waren das erste und das letzte Mal dort. Siehe unten!
Bedienung
Wir hatten telefonisch einen Tisch f r 2 bestellt. Vom Kellner wurden wir an einen Tisch platziert, der direkt neben dem Besteckschrank war. Aus diesem wurde w hrend unseres Aufenthaltes permanent Besteck auf Teller geknallt und in geb ckter Haltung an unserem Tisch vorbeigeschlichen.
Der Tisch wurde nicht vom Bestellkellner abger umt, sondern wortlos von einem Mann in Stra enkleidung, also mit Trenchcoat.
Das Essen
Zur Vorspeise hatten wir Carpaccio bestellt. Auf unsere Frage, ob dies mit Rucola sei, wurde selbstverst ndlich geantwortet. Auf meine Bitte, den Rucola wegzulassen, da ich diesen nicht mag, wurde mir geantwortet, das geht nicht,  dann machen wir es eben mit Eisbergsalat. Auf die Bitte meines Mannes, das ganze ohne Salat zu servieren ist der Kellner wortlos davongegangen. Bekommen haben wir dann ein Carpaccio, das  ber und  ber  mit rohen Champigons belegt war. Als unsere Vorspeisenteller abger umt wurden, wurden wir gefragt, wie es war. Meine Antwort, da  zu viele Champignons drauf waren, wurde mit einem L cheln und Gemurmel quittiert. Ich hatte den Eindruck, da  ich nicht verstanden wurde.
Zur Hauptspeise hatte mein Mann Ravioli mit Kalbfleischf llung mit frischen Karotten und Erbsen auf Tomatensosse. Das ganze kam sehr angetrocknet, die Karotten waren von der Form her Dose oder Glas.
Ich hatte Tagliatelle mit gr nem Spargel auf einer leichten Gamba-Sahne-Sauce. Die Nudeln waren einwandfrei bissfest, die leichte Sahne-Sauce entpuppte sich als stopfende und viel zu schwere Sahne-Sauce.

Tische waren eingedeckt, Sie wurden von einer jungen Dame mit wei en Stoffhandschuhen eingedeckt; f r mich in diesem Lokal v llig fehl am Platze.

Lage -  als Orientierungspunkt, das Restaurant befindet sich direkt am Wasserturm von Sindelfingen, direkt an einer relativ wenig befahrenen Durchgangstrasse . 
In der N he (ca. 10 Gehminuten) befindet sich eine S-Bahn Haltestelle;
Parkplatz - Mit etwas Gl ck in der N he vorhanden.
Publikum - Gemischtes Publikum,
Sehr gute Italienische K che !
Das Lokal ist zu empfehlen !
Bedienung
Man wurde sehr freundlich und famili r begr sst, wenn man aussen s tzen m chte, ist es ratsam vorher einen Tisch zu reservieren.
Der Kellner ging absolut auf unserer W nsche ein. Wie z.B. eine Vorspeise, zwei Hauptgerichte zusammen, es gab automatisch 2 Teller, alles kein Problem !!!
Das Essen
Da wir das erste Mal dort hinkamen und der  ussere Eindruck eher schlicht ist, umso mehr waren wir von der Qualit t des Essens sehr positiv  berrascht.
Wir hatten gemischte Antipasti, die lecker war. Der gemischte Salat mit hauseigenem Dressing war ebenfalls lecker. Die Kr nung war, in der K hlteke vorher zu besichtigen, das frische Lachsfilet. Garpunkt, R ststoffanteil und die Marinade - Alles Perfekt !!!! Nicht zu vergessen das Gem se das ebenfalls sehr lecker zubereitet wurde.
Weinempfehlung: Als Erstes habe ich einen besseren Frascati getrunken. Der aber meinen Geschmack nicht entsprach. Auch hier kein Problem, der Kellner brachte eine Flasche weissen Ciro aus Sizilien  ffnete ihn, obwohl wir nur 2 Gl ser bestellt haben. Der Wein war  berraschend frisch und nicht  lig also nicht zu schwer. Auch hier ein Volltreffer !
Es gibt auch eine eigene Pastaherstellung wo man zuschauen und nat rlich bestellen kann.
Das Ambiente
Innen, einfach aber gem tlich. Aussen, sitzt man direkt an der Strasse wo ein wenig Verkehr herrscht.
Im Untergeschoss befindet sich eine Kegelbahn.

Letztens a  meine Begleitung ein Nudelgericht mit Steinpilzen und ich hatte mir eine Dorade geg nnt. Dazu gab es einen angenehm gek hlten Wei wein (Marani).

bj0ZrL2V2FTvGSrhky06-g,lDbITzXjjkXYBXQ--RZwQQ,2010-03-05,0,"Aufmerksam geworden durch eine sehr positive Bewertung des Restaurants in diesem Portal, die insbesondere auf das dort bewertete Candle-Light-Dinner hinwies, entschloss ich mich meine Freundin ebenfalls mit einem solchen Dinner anl sslich eines besonderen Ereignisses zu  berraschen. Ich nahm per eMail Kontakt mit dem Restaurant auf und bekam direkt Antwort vom Besitzer der gleichzeitig auch der Chefkoch ist. Mit ein paar kurzen Mails zwischen uns, kl rten wir in etwa die Speisenfolge f r unser Men  und letztlich versprach uns der Chef er w rde uns mit einem k stlichen F nf-G nge-Men   berraschen. Auf diesen Deal liess ich mich ein und das war definitiv kein Fehler sondern eine gute und richtige Entscheidung.
Als wir an dem Abend im Restaurant ankamen, wartete auf uns bereits ein liebevoll mit Rosenbl ttern, einem Rosenstrau  und einem silbernen Kandelaber mit aprikotfarbenen Kerzen dekorierter, edel mit Stofftischdecke und Stoffservietten eingedeckter Tisch.
Der  u erst freundliche Kellner begr  te uns und f hrte uns zu unsere mTisch. Unaufgefordert brachte er uns dann sogleich je ien Glas Prosecco als Aperitiv und zum Anstossen auf den Abend. In diesem Moment erschien auch der Chef selbst. Er kam aus der K che, begr  te uns ebenfalls sehr freudnlich und erl uterte uns mit welchen Gen ssen er uns nun zu verw hnen gedachte.
Die Speisenfolge die er f r uns ausgesucht hatte war folgende:
1. Lachstranchen auf Wei brot mit ged nsteten Gem sestreifen 2. Vitello Tonnato mit selbstgebackenem Pizzaofenbrot3. Teigtaschen gef llt mit Ricotta-Scampi-Lachs-Farce auf karamellisiertem Spinatbett4. Gegrillter Wolfsbarsch an w rziger Orangensauce mit Pizzaofenbrot5. Panna Cotta auf Kramellspiegel
Dazu empfahl er uns als Getr nk einen Weisswein, den wir allerdings nach kurzer Diskussion (da wir lieber Rotwein trinken) in einen 2003er Vino Nobile di Montepulciano umwandelten.
Die Speisen die gereicht wurden, waren alle von erlesener Qualit t und Frische. Jeder Gang - das war deutlich erkennbar - war vom Chef mit Kreativit t und Hingabe zubereitet worden.
Die Speisen waren auf Geschirr unterschiedlicher Form, sehr dekorativ und liebevoll angerichtet und waren k stlich im Geschmack. Die Mengen waren eher zu gro z gig denn zu knapp bemessen und wir konnten meist die jeweilige Menge nicht vollst ndig verzehren.
Das  u erst aufmerksame und dennoch sich dezent im Hintergrund  haltende Servicepersonal, sorgte daf r dass immer die Gl ser mit Wein (der nat rlich dekantiert worden war und in einem Dekanter gereicht wurde) und auch Wasser gef llt waren, sowie wurde stets dezent nachgefragt, ob die Speisen und auch alles andere zu unserer Zufriednheit sei und ob ggf. etwas zus tzliches - wie z.B. ein Espresso zwischendurch - gereicht werden d rfe.
Die absolute Kr nung dieses ohnehin genial positiven gastronomischen Erlebnisses kam am Schluss, nach dem k stlichen Dessert, als der Chef aus der K che sich - nach vorherigem Fragen selbstverst ndlich - mit zu uns an den Tisch sass, uns noch einen hervorragenden Grappa als Digestive und auf Kosten des Hauses anbot.
Vorher hatte er allerdings noch gefragt, ob er ein Foto von uns an diesem besondern Abend machen und uns noch ein Geschenk zum mitnehmen anbieten d rfe.
Kurz, das Foto diente dazu von ihm auf ein T-Shirt gedruckt zu werden, das er uns als Abschiedsgeschenk  berreichte und dabei sehr ehrlcih sich daf r bedankte, dass wir seine G ste waren und ihn und seine Speisen und sein Team gelobt haben.
Der absolute Knaller kam nun aber ganz zum Schluss, als ich eher im Spass erw hnte, dass ich aufgrund des doch mehr als erwarteten Genusses von Prosecco, Wein und Grappa nun wohl doch ein Taxi rufen m sse und meinen Wagen dann eben am n chsten Morgen irgendwie abholen m sse. Da bot sich der Chef spontan an, nat rlich nur wenn es uns recht w re, uns mit unserem eigenen Wagen nach Hause zu fahren und sein Chefkellner mit seinem Wagen hinterher, so da  er wieder zur ck kommen w rde.
Wir haben das tats chlich so gemacht und ich kann nur sagen, die Jungs und M dels im La Romantica sowie das was sie bieten ist allererste Klasse und man wird so etwas und vor allem so eine Einstellung so leicht nirgendwo sonst finden!
Eines ist sicher, wann immer wir k nftig in der N he sein werden, werden wir sicher dort wieder einkehren und ich bin fast sicher, vermutlich wie alte Freunde begr  t und verw hnt werden!
Fazit: Nicht nur empfehelnswert sondern ein absolutes Muss f r jeden Gourmet und Freund italienischer Gastfreundlichkeit!
 brigens, es soll nicht unerw hnt bleiben, dass der zu entrichtende Preis f r diesen genialen Abend inkl. allen Getr nken usw. mit rund 100  auch wohl als mehr als preiswert zu bewerten ist.",0,5,1J4JklvKtxdZEQ4wJM0j6Q,review,0

Mac 'n cheese was too hot for the baby to eat at first, but he wolfed it down eventually. My scrambled eggs were overdone and lukewarm. This place does not know how to do scrambled eggs. Waitress asked if I wanted my bacon crispy and I said yes - it came out almost burnt and cold. The toast was so smeared with butter substitute that it was soggy and cold by the time I got to it. Husband's order was wrong - eggs over easy turned into scrambled eggs, and his eggs were overdone too. He enjoyed his sausage and pancakes though, and I thoroughly enjoyed my hashbrowns. They were delicious. Granddaughter liked her kids' menu French toast and ate most of it. My coffee was good, but I had to bring my own flavored creamer - all they have is plain cream and sugar.

Our waitress asked when we first were seated if we'd been there before, and we said yes. She breezed by 15 minutes later and asked the same question again. We said yes again. She seemed very rushed, distracted, and not terribly friendly. The place was busy, so maybe she was overworked, but we ended up feeling rushed too. 

Our waitress brought two loyalty cards with our bill, both with one stamp on them - she didn't ask if we already had a loyalty  card. Did she miss the part where we said yes, we'd been there before? When I presented my loyalty card to her and asked her to put the two new stamps on my card, she said (with attitude), ""We don't combine cards!"" I had to explain that she didn't even ask if I had one, and that I simply wanted her to stamp my card instead of giving us two new ones. She gave me one stamp on top of a spot that was already stamped, and when I pointed it out, she just gave me a new card with one additional stamp. We never did get that second extra stamp, but by that time, we were done with her. We left a minimal tip.

Today's experience is pretty typical in terms of food quality. We go only if we have coupons. Unless I have a really great deal, like a Groupon or a two-for-one, I'll never visit 5 and Diner again. It simply doesn't impress me with its service or its food.",0,2,6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA,review,0

The owner, Val, is wonderful. Boy, she works hard and cares about her customers and her staff. 

Much of her staff has been at this location forever, and Val has owned this restaurant for 13 years. Sometimes she has an awesome magician there.. and I usually hate when those magicians come by our table when I'm trying to enjoy my dinner. 

So.. I love the people who work there, and I love the fun, festive atmosphere most of the time (depending on my mood). I love the music - though sometimes it's too loud. Again, this is probably due to whether I'm tired or my daughter is bugging me too much or I happen to have a headache, etc. I'm sure Val would turn down the music if you asked her to do so. She REALLY aims to please. 

The food - sometimes very good and sometimes ho-hum, depending on what you order. It's what I would expect for a Five and Diner, which is why I give it four-star rating over all. What can I say?  I'm very picky about my food and my staff and my atmosphere. 

The fries are great when you order them extra-crispy (which is how I always order my fries if I happen to get them). The club sandwich is great and HUGE - an excellent value. My husband ALWAYS orders the club sandwich, which he loves.  

I order a variety of items whenever we go there, and I've found the breakfast items for dinner usually suit me the best. Tip: get the biscuits and skip the toast or tortilla, or hash browns, etc.. My daughter loves their macaroni and cheese and all their other kid items. I believe kid menu items are 99 cents when an adult purchases an entree on M-F. If not M-F, I know for sure kids are 99 cents on Fridays.",0,4,6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA,review,0

We came for breakfast and were bowled away by how great the service was - the waiter had every possible configuration of questions on how we'd like out food, and even offered salsa as soon as the entrees came out.  I wasn't planning on salsa for my Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs but sure, what the hell.  Well, the salsa was delicious with the perfect amount of kick - I ended up dousing my buttery hashbrowns in it and going to town.  Eggs and chicken fried steak were both tasty and the toast was thick cut and good to sop up the extra gravy.  My husband had an omlette which he seemed to enjoy, though the portion looked just a tad small.  Truly a yummy 3-star meal, though the great service just bumped things up even more.  They were just SO nice and so insistent that we come back, I'm wondering if the location (in the Arizona Mills parking lot) is making the business struggle a bit.

Chicken Pot Pie ( ""NEW"" ) is not much more in quantity than the $3.50 frozen Swanson version you can cook at home.  Nothing remarkable here either.

French fries were hot and crunchy and good.  Best part of the meal.

Worst part:  The AWFUL chicken strips.  You know those mass-market wholesale version strips that are 90% thick, heavy breading and leave you about a 10% chicken portion?  Yep, they use those.  There is a layer of impossibly hard and tasteless breading on the outside, then a little thin moist layer of unfried breading under that, and then in the small remaining center a smidgen of real chicken.  NEGATIVE 500 STARS on the gross chicken strips.

QRIFsMi7CFr1c4leraMxNw,zA8FkBuyUgd68NoUSL12CQ,2011-04-11,3,"My wife and I needed a place to grab some lunchtime breakfast food over the weekend, and seeing as how we couldn't find anything better, we stopped by 5 and Diner. I've never been overly impressed with 5 and Diner in the past, and I have to say, they met my mediocre expectations this round as well. My wife ordered the pancake sandwich with two eggs and I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy with raisin toast. None of which was better than what you can make at home, but it wasn't disappointing either.

Overall, the service wasn't too slow considering how busy it was and I didn't have any trouble getting refills. However, here's where the problem comes in. When my wife ordered the pancake sandwich the server asked my wife ""do you like bacon or sausage"", to which she replied ""bacon"". Normal question when ordering breakfast right? Well, when the bill came, little did we know that the pancake sandwich didn't actually come with bacon and the server put a dollar charge on the tab for adding bacon. When I confronted her about the dollar charge she said ""the pancake sandwich doesn't come with bacon, that's extra"". Well, we weren't informed that answering a question as to preference would result in an extra charge. We weren't informed that she was in fact adding things to our tab to inflate the price without telling us. I put up enough of a fuss that she removed the charge, and  I could tell that she knew she had added the charge in a duplicitous manner and she was just hoping we wouldn't catch on. The food was decent, but I have a big problem with dishonest servers and that's what knocks this place down from being a decent breakfast joint to just another bump on the road of mediocre cuisine.",0,2,6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA,review,0

Okay, it's the sweet and sassy waitress.  She can sell me anything.  Even dessert, when I am not hungry.

The food is mediocre.  I recommend sticking with breakfast items.  On this last visit, we ordered dinner.  The pot pie was okay and included a big dinner salad for about $8.  Not bad.  

I somehow ended up spending $40+ for two adults and two kids on my last visit, even though kids were supposed to be 99 cents with the purchase of each adult entree.  

Part of the inflated check was that the aforementioned waitress upsold the dessert to us at $3.99 per slice of cake or pie.  Let me review that dessert now.

Carrot cake?  Nearly inedible.  With two people splitting a piece, 1/3 of it got eaten.  It tasted like it had been in a freezer.  DH, who loves carrot cake and could eat a whole sheet by himself could barely swallow a bite.  The 9 year old girl who ordered it said... ""this does not even taste like carrots.""  I thought it tasted like a dry spice cake that had been frozen for a few months and then defrosted on the counter overnight.  

Cherry pie?  YUCK.  I split a piece with DD on her insistence.  I ate two bites.  I have to admit I am no pie connoisseur, but this was NOT good.  It was too-sweet, canned cherries in a tasteless crust.  Every cherry pie I have had before has had tart cherries.  I don't know how they got these that sweet, but it was just disgusting.  If a 4 year old who is usually never allowed sweets cannot finish off dessert, there is a problem.

Still, the atmosphere is cute.  The decor is interesting for the kids.

However, I have now had two disappointing meals at the diner at the Arizona MIlls in Tempe. Today's lunch was a terrible affair.

We arrived at about 12:30PM and there was maybe only two or three tables occupied. What we'd hoped would mean quick service was anything but. It took forever to get a waitress to take our order, and then a very long time for our meal.

I ordered a bacon cheeseburger (was not asked about how done I wanted it, what kind of cheese or anything -- just boom, bacon cheeseburger, NEXT) and my fiancee ordered the chicken finger appetizer.

My burger was beyond well done, and dry, but greasy from the cheese and sauces. Furthermore the burger was cold -- and not just from the lettuce. I was hungry and waited too long to bother sending it back. I choked it down with the aid of some decent fries.

M'lady's chicken fingers were mistakenly upgraded to a dinner plate, which included fries, corn on the cob, a biscuit, and gravy! So we basically paid double for an order for too much food because the waitress -- or cook -- didn't get the order right.

Not even quite okay but just BLAH. I ordered the sliders. Here's my opinion folks for what it is worth: Whenever I have ordered sliders ANYWHERE in the country the sliders have always come THREE to an order. This one was only two small burgers with a mountain of fries to compensate. The fries were good don't get me wrong. The sliders were okay. There was only meat and cheese on them. The onions and tomato were on the side and they were raw instead of cooked onions. Traditional sliders come with chopped grilled onions on them. Also my wife ordered a chocolate malt. It wasn't malty. It tasted more like a chocolate sunday instead of a malt. Service was just okay. We had to wait an inordinate amount of time to be served and also for our check to get out of there. Biggest complaint: It was WAY HOT in there and we had to ask to have them turn on the A/C. They turned on the ceiling fans without the A/C and we were still uncomfortable but it was somewhat bearable. I would strongly recommend that if you want the look and feel of a genuine 50's diner with food and service to match that you go elsewhere.,0,2,6Rrlg6hnM0ir7ijhKG2ybA,review,0

Stepping inside, the atmosphere was dark and intimate, a good place to take out a date to talk and drink wine together. The LCD tv at the center of the bar kind of ruins that mood a bit though. Monday night football was on and no one was really paying attention to it because everyone was involved in their own intimate private conversation and having one tv in this type of setup just doesn't blend in well.

Despite having only one server that night, she was very attentive to everyone inside. I'll give the service a good review. I ordered the mixto ceviche (shrimp, scallop and calimari). The tortilla came separate with it which were served in potato chips size pieces.  Taste was ok but thats because I prefer my ceviche with a heavy lime taste.  I also ordered the fish taco which came in 3 small pieces.  I tasted my friends tuna ceviche too which I recommend to anyone that comes here. It was the best dish we had on our table.

So if you're ever around town square at night and on a movie date, stop by this place after. Great way to end a night if you don't feel like partying in the neighboring bars and just in a mood to have a quiet place to eat and have a conversation.",4,3,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,review,2

Food- I came here the night before Easter Sunday. So, I was not able to try any of the meat dishes.  The food is a bit disappointing. After you have the tapas at Firefly, it is difficult  to match the quality, quantity and taste of the food. 

Location-The location is great. Across from Blue Martini and steps away from the movie theaters. Town square is a great location. 

Price- A bit on the steep side. You do not get enough bang for your buck. You cannot really expect much because of the expensive rent  these places have to pay at Town Square. 

Service - It is OK, nothing special.

I heard a lot about ""TRUFFLE CHIPS"" but all I could taste was the truffle oil. The ceviche was okay but overpriced. Overall, the restaurant is beautiful and the patio is great as it looks over townsquare park. I would possibly go back for sangria but nothing else...

Ck6O0cRtKLR6wTG32MwtHA,09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA,2010-03-07,1,"A nice location sandwiched between Bar Louie and Blue Martini at Town Square. I have to say that this should be ""the"" spot of the summer (for drinks). It has a central location, Miami-ish d cor, balcony that overlooks the Town Square park, and two additional balconies on both sides that are all perfect for people watching. Additionally, throw in the mojitos and tapas and we have the perfect summer spot. 
However, there are a couple things they need to work on.  The servers were amazing. The bartenders were a little slow and unresponsive but seeing the work it takes to make a mojito, I understand. 

What was strange was the managers that stood around and did nothing. No hi, no bye, nothing, just stood there taking up space. At first, I figured that maybe they were customers but later found out they were managers who just got in the way of the servers and the customers. It'd be better if they would of had personalities. Hopefully, that'll change as business increases.

The sangria was amazing ... and I don't even like sweet drinks. But the food was very subpar. It's nothing special and was very mediocre compared to a place like Firefly. As a matter of fact we ordered about ten different items on the menu and maybe the only thing that stood out was the mushroom ceviche and the dates with bacon (even though Firefly's is better but how do you mess up something with bacon wrapped around it anyway). Everything else was ... eh and will not have me running back there to eat. With places that have waaaaayyyy better food within walking distance (Johhny McGuire's, Yardhouse, Bar Louie, and even Cadillac Ranch) I'd rather eat somewhere else and afterwards go grab a couple drinks at night here.",1,3,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,review,1

I had two strawberry.

This was my experience. I called in the afternoon to make a dinner reservation, and I was told I don't need one. Should've been a red flag. After much persistance, I convinced the host to just reserve me a table anyway. When I arrived, my party wasn't there yet, so I took my table because the bar was full. I wasn't offered a beverage for quite some time. 

When my friends arrived, they received warm water with no ice in a sticky glass. My sangria took a very long time to make. We ordered 3 dishes after waiting quite some time for our waitress. After about 20 minutes, the waitress told us that the chef had just informed her they were out of salmon... We were starving! Did she wait 20 minutes to put in the order? People around us were getting food. 

The first dish to arrive was mini chorizo corn dogs. Flavor was terrible, no spice at all. The texture was even worse. Next we received the item that we substituted for the salmon, which was a crab ceviche. Completely over salted, and was more like tuna than crab. 

Finally our 3rd dish arrived, the hirame ceviche. When the waitress described it to us, she mentioned it was the special of the night which came with a salad. There was no salad. No greens. Nothing. This one was at least slightly tasty compared to the others, but it wasn't amazing. I contemplated dessert, but couldn't justify giving this establishment another cent. 

I was very glad that some of the people I was planning to dine with couldn't make it. I would hate for them to suffer through this meal. It was awful. Service - poor, food - poor, drinks - poor. 

I will say, however, that the place is decorated nicely. Wouldn't be bad to stop in for a beer before or after a movie. I just wouldn't eat. Not sure this place will stay open long, it was pretty empty when we went, and, in the words of the hostess, reservations aren't really needed.",2,1,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,review,2

I didn't try much of their menu, save for their beef empenadas.  I found them to be tasty and well cooked.  Since I stuck with that, the pricing was respectable.  I had also tried their ""Fire Water"" drink based off the name alone, and I found it to be enjoyable as well.  A bit of a small glass, but the flavor was good.

I don't want to rate it any higher on the grounds that I only had one menu and drink selection, and they were more of a quick snack than a full meal, but my friend and I enjoyed our individual meal selections, and the overall vibe and view were pleasant.

Perhaps in returning at a later time, I'd be able to make a more concrete decision on where I want to place my enjoyment factor, but the first impression was pleasant enough to want to check it out again.",1,4,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,review,0

But if you do not love this place you are missing a key part of your ""foodie"" DNA. This restaurant is the answer to every time you've said ""I wish I could try 5 plates"".  Tapas is small plates of each. Needless to say, when I got back to NY, I looked up a ceviche place within 24 hours.

If you are going once I'd recommend trying the ceviche, piggy back dates in goat cheese mouse, shrimp in chicharran sauce, short ribs and save room for homemade churros or that chocolate kiss with sea salt and chipotle sauce (?!?!?) 

- Hamachi ceviche - for those rookies like me....this is like sashimi/fish ""cooked"" in citrus by the acid. I've never had pickled hot peppers but its like sweet hot tangy awesomeness. (is it obvious I'm not a professional reviewer?) 

Shrimp in chicharran sauce - crispy shrimp (they use 3 flours) with a little bit of pop. 

Short ribs -- one large short rib in guava glaze. Its probably the best bbq sauce with rich, slightly tangy, but smooth flavor. The meat was fall off the bone tender. 

Piggy back dates -- a must have. dates wrapped in bacon with an almond inside for some pop and then in a bed of white mousse. Come on!  I could eat these on the coach all day.  Best dish. A must have. 

- Mojitos - I have to admit I didn't have but was with 10 people and the mixed drinks and variations on the mojito shocked people. ""Not as sweet"" as most. 

Lastly, service was perfect as you'd expect the timing for each dish to be difficult. 

I want to sit outside next time but it was packed so that wasn't possible but they seem to have the best view in town square. 

Gun to my head I'd say I didn't like the chicken skewers but it turned out they were missing the rum glaze so that was the reason. 

I think what I loved most was just the variations on every dish. Yes they have corn dogs but they have chorizo. Yes the have mac and cheese but its has habanero in it. Piggy back dates with almonds and white mousse? Can you picture what that taste like? There's something for everyone here. Ceviche, mac and cheese, shrimp, pickled jalapenos, bread pudding. Not joking this place reminded me of dishes at Nobu and as I said to a friend, ""I'm not just saying this, but this might be the best meal I ever had"" I felt like I was trying to find something I didn't find mindblowing to seem credible when I told friends about it. I was asking locals at the malls if they had been. I'll wait for Cana NYC to open up.",0,5,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,review,0

Crab was more like a crab salad and had a metallic taste as if it were canned.  The crab ceviche was the only dish that wasn't excellent.

_SOxX5KhLB87ljcVUcsNHw,kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,2010-02-23,5,"My new favorite bar /hangout spot in the city of Las Vegas ! I know everyone on Yelp is obsessed with Firefly, but I can now confidently say I much prefer Cana! Before I get onto the main review, a few reasons why this place kicks Firefly's butt:

*Well crafted, DELICIOUS drinks. I know we all love those sugary mojitos at Firefly, but the flavorings are all just powders and artificial. The fruit mojitos here are muddled with real fresh fruit - they used a half pint of blueberries on one freaking mojito that I watched them make! I much prefer real fruit to powdered mixes, but to each his own.

*Service is exponentially better. The bartenders will actually take the time to get to know you and make sure you love your drink. My mojito gets thrown at me with no hello at FireFly

*Atmosphere. I love the sexy lounge/patio they have going! Happy hour is till 7, instead of ending at 6 PM like it does on FF on Paradise. 

--------------------------

I've said it once and I'll say it again - the drinks are awesome and they are why I come here. The mojitos are muddled with fresh fruit, and they have some awesome martinis. I do have to give the edge to Firefly on the sangria, however. They only have one kind at Cana and it's just oK.

We've tried half the menu and love nearly everything we've tried. I think the low point is sadly  the ceviche. We tried their best selling yellowtail ceviche and while it was fresh, I don't like their funky new style. If I want ceviche I want small pieces of fish, not 4 huge ugly slabs. It was sloppy and uninspired imo.

On the flip side, we really loved the beef empanadas. They aren't traditional, but wow the puff pastry dough is good. The mac and cheese is great as are the sliders. The flat breads and shrimp are both great and hearty portions to boot. I think our favorite was the short rib. A pretty damn big slab for $12 and covered in the most delicious sauce. 

If you're a Firefly regular - give it a try. It's more sophisticated and the drinks are way better! You might just like it .",4,5,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,review,2

We sat out on the patio to enjoy the nice night and because they only allowed happy hour specials at the bar/patio.  However, we would rather sit out there because it was just too dark in the dining area.

These are the tapas we ordered:
-Mac and cheese with the habenero:  We all liked this very much that we  doubled the initial quantity.  The habenero gave this tapa a lil kick and was a wonderful compliment.

-Beef empanadas-this was everyone's favorite.  Was light and fluffy with ground beef and other spices in the middle...yum

-Chicken empanada-not as good as the beef empanadas, but is aight.

-Spicy tuna ceviche-one of us doesn't eat sushi/sashimi, but she thought this was delicious.  I honestly thought it was a bit too fishy while everyone else liked it.

-Hamachi tiradito-the citrus brought out the flavor of this fish.  Was light and refreshing.  Was one of everyone's favorite.

-Cuban Sliders-ham on top of pork, was kinda boring to me.  I like cuban sandwiches when there is a dipping sauce.  This one doesn't come with a dipping sauce.

-Crispy Shrimp-one said that this reminds her of honey walnut shrimp, I didn't care too much for it.  The shrimps were tiny.

-Beef taco-Better than the fish, not as good as the chicken taco.  The portion seem to be tiny for the amount of pickled cabbage given.

-Chicken taco-Taste the best out of the three kinds of taco.  The pickled purple cabbage and a slice of jalapeno tasted very good with this chicken taco.

-Fish taco-least favorite...the fish was BORING.  Didn't taste like much.

-Churros-Everyone loved this desert.  It was so soft and fluffy, with a nice vanilla sauce (I think) drizzled on top of it.  Not a typical churro that one would get at El Pollo Loco, which I like too btw.

Sopapillas-Eh.  Whatevers.  A rectangular baked dough on a dish of honey and powdered sugar.  

Sugarcane sangria-This was GOOD.  Even for non-drinkers as myself.  Was very fruity with fruit pulp.  

Blackberry mojito-Was on the tart side.  No one liked this pitcher very much...

This cost us $75 after tip. We left still starving after a day of laying by the pool in the sun, and grumpy for wasting money. 
The only reason I gave two stars as opposed to one, is because I saw the bartender totally hook it up in our pitcher of mojito. He probably used half the bacardi bottle on us.

The Ceviche: Lychee/lime/lavender
The flatbread pizza: Grilled Chicken/mango/cilantro/queso blanco
The Mac & Cheese: with Habaner jace (my favorite)
The Lamb Chops: with mint chimichurri (okay, also my favorite)
Tried two of the three desserts: Bread Pudding with banana/rum sauce and the Chocolate Kiss, with Chipolte Foam... was not a fan of the foam...

Went here for DINNER last night with some friends. 

Ambiance: 
low lighting, dark woods, modern feel, one big open room with tables plus outdoor patio seating which looked like it would be a great way to go in the Fall and Spring... they had cool (I thought they were cool) paper-like, scrunched lanterns hanging from the ceiling 

Menu: 
2-page menu.... 1-page for drinks and 1-page for food 
What's cool is that they keep it simple but it's not a far reaching menu like some other tapas places I've been to... and if you're vegetarian this is NOT the place for you... I think there were 2 items on the menu that did not have meat or were meat based 

Downside: (and this is why I'd give them 3 stars) they were out of a number of items 
- out of all but 2 wines 
- out of 2 of the 8 beers 
- out of the short rib tacos and some other dish that I can't remember 

Taste: 
Excellent... everything we ordered was very tasty and well executed with a flair for presentation. 
Note: the portions are not super big.... so each plate is good for 2 people... we often ordered multiples. 

Enjoyed the Tuna Ceviche... Chicken Empanadas (now these were on the big side).... Chicken Tacos... Fish Tacos... Crispy Shrimp 

Dessert: 
WOW! If you like bread pudding... or even if you are just mildly interested.... try their Banana Bread Pudding.... YUM! It doesn't look like much when it comes out... but then you take a bite. Oh MY! :) 
We also ordered the Churros which were more like Cinnamon twists.. nevertheless... very good as well and I dipped the churros in the sauce the BBP came in... oh Yea! 

Service: 
Our waiter was cool.... super busy as it seemed like he was only 1 of 2 guys taking care of all the tables and it was a pretty busy night... almost all the tables were filled plus a big party of 10 
The hostess was ... I guess... I'd say indifferent... she wasn't mean but she wasn't friendly either so.... 

Drinks: 
I ordered the raspberry mojito... and to me ... it was way too sweet... I personally think it needed more rum and less sugarcane but that's me. Plus they muddled the heck out of it so that there weren't pieces of fruit swimming around as I had expected... I like the chunks of fruit in my muddled mojito... I know... I'm strange. 

The white sangria however was FABULOUS... it too was sweet but in a different way. I know... that doesn't make sense... so let's just say this drink would be perfect for sitting by the pool .... refreshing and delightful.

Much better than Firefly where the dates are served soaking in a bowl of bacon grease (although I have to admit that Firefly introduced me to this dish so I shoudln't complain).

The best part about my experience was the service. John is an amazing bar tender. All of the bartenders are very friendly and focused on the customer. They were genuinely interested in whether or not we liked our food and drinks. John introduced us to Cory, the owner, who is also a friendly, genuine person.  I don't think you'll find better service anywhere in Vegas, really. I have been going to Firefly for years and have never left feeling like the employees knew me or cared about my return. It's the opposite at Cana.

I can't wait to go here when the weather gets nice too--large windows open up to the bar--it's a great indoor/outdoor space. Even though it was rainy and cold this Saturday, it was a fun place to be.",0,4,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,review,0

I loooved this place and it was not as annoyingly busy and loud as Firefly. 

We got spicy tune ceviche..amazing especially with the chip thingys they bring out with it, beef emenadas..the crust is super flaky and yummy, mac n cheese..SO good and surprisingly spicy, and the meatballs.

We're told not to worry since we'd be sheltered from the wind. We get outside and we asked to sit at the only table located in the sun. 

As we are looking at the menu and finally warm up, the hostess comes back to our table and asked us to move to another table in the shade since apparently, the table in the sun is going to be used by the big party. Which by the way, we have yet seen.

I had far more food that I normally do but was glad I tried out so many things.  I'll list it out since my eyes were very hungry that night.:

Hamachi - fresh and zesty
Duck Empanada - delicious unique butter crust and sweet to bite
Mac N Cheese - so bad for you but so good when it hits your lips
Calamari - crispy and peppery and using the dipping sauce really adds to the flavor
Pork Chops - Loved the marinade, tender, and full of flavor
Bread Pudding - This hit all my senses as soon as it hit the table and really lived up to expectations
Churros - Best churro I've ever had, arrived warm and hot and the glaze just really made the flavor jump in you mouth.

My friend had the white wine sangria and was very satisfied which is quite the compliment since she's very discerning.  I had a faux-jito, which was equally flavorful and fun.

Most dishes hover right above $10, and the portions certainly do not match what you're paying for.  Last night was my third visit here, and each time I've been sure to stop by during happy hour.  Happy hour is from 5pm-7pm daily and gets you the following items at discount price (discount prices are listed below, and are approx. ~50% off full price, plus or minus $1):

Beef Empanadas, $6.00 - It's alright.  Ground beef with some veggies inside pastry bread.  I'll eat it but it's not my first choice.  Comes with two empanadas, each cut in half.
Mac & Cheese, $4.00 - This is some tasty mac & cheese, using white cheese, cheddar cheese and some habanero.  The kick from the habanero makes this something that I would order every visit.  Portion is good for two, maybe three less-hungry people.
Cuban Sliders, $6.00 - These are delicious little burgers!  Made with ground pork, with a little ham thrown on top just because.  They've been juicy and full of flavor every time I've ordered these (which happens to be every time I've been here).  Order comes with three sliders, which are small to begin with.  Not worth full price.
Crispy Shrimp, $6.00 - Yes, it is pieces of shrimp.  Yes, it was probably crunchy at some time with some sort of breading.  But no, it is not crispy when it arrives.  Last night was the first time I ordered it, and the sauce it comes with (panko?) made the shrimp soggy.  It had a citrus flavor and wasn't bad, but I can't see myself ordering it again.  Portion was decent enough for two to share.
Chicken Skewers, $? - The fifth and final food item on the happy hour menu.  The menu is small to begin with, and only five items are offered with happy hour pricing!  I *think* I had this during a previous visit but I'm not sure.  I didn't order it last night.
Sangria, $5.00 - I think there were a couple varieties offered during happy hour, each being $5.00.  It's not my favorite drink so I didn't order.

During my visits it seems that on average people are paying roughly $15-$20 per person depending on who gets drinks.  When I go to Firefly with a group it's usually about $20 per person and the food is tastier, with more generous portions.  Cana's food is good from what I've tasted so far, but the prices are scaring me off from trying the other items, no matter how good they look.",1,3,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,review,0

The service was good, and the ambiance is contemporary and inviting, however it's not the kind of place to indulge in, just feeling like snacking and paying $70 a person for basically an appetizer.

The waitress told me: I don't like soccer, I don't watch it, so, I don't know where they broadcast the game"".  I just start  seeping my Mojito and forgot about the game.

f3eDO1zvEFN_Gep0nFnsqA,C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,2010-02-14,1,"I'm a sucker for tapas (or bocadillos in this case -- although I used to think bocadillos were sandwiches, which shows you how much I know, but I digress...). So, when I saw this place in Town Square I had to check it out.

First of all, there are 2 entries for Ca a on yelp. Both refer to the same place but one has the address wrong. The correct address is 6599 Las Vegas Blvd. I'm posting my review under both.

Now for the review... Ca a is located in the spot vacated by Louis's Fish Camp and they did a great job of remodeling the space. Louis's had a small bar and the entry way was a little odd -- kinda felt like you were walking in through the back door to get into the restaurant because of the small door, walking by the bathrooms and getting a glimpse of the ""behind the bar"" area before getting to the dining area. With Ca a, the doorway is larger and more inviting and the bar is pushed back, adjoining the patio areas. The interior of the place is much darker and intimate as well. The bathrooms are in the same location but are not as pronounced.

As for the food... ehh... it was ok but not great.  Not even ""really good"" either.

- Hamachi ceviche -- as other reviews have mentioned they are not traditional ceviches. They're more like sashimi slices laying on a streak of citrus sauce. Hardly enough citrus to 'cook' the hamachi. It didn't taste all that fresh and lacked flavor.

- Short ribs -- one large short rib in a deep pool of guava glaze. The meat was very tender but didn't have much depth in flavor. A few more spices would have given it some kick and made this a great dish, but the meat all on its own was a little dull.

- Piggy back dates -- It seems like every tapas/bocadillos place HAS to have bacon wrapped dates. I guess I should be glad that this place did, because it was the best dish of the night. Great textures (although the amount of goat cheese mousse was overkill) and great flavors.

- Beef empanadas -- the outside of the empanadas was flaky and a little crispy. The inside could have used more beef. Almost every bite was pastry with a hint of beef. The beef tasted pretty good, I just wanted more of it.

- Crispy shrimp -- decent flavor, not as crispy as I would have liked.

- Sangria -- while it did taste good, it wasn't strong enough and was too sweet. It wasn't what I was expecting.

We sat at the bar on a Saturday night and didn't have any trouble finding seats. The service was very good. Our bartender was on top of things and we didn't have to wait long for drinks or food even though he and the other bartenders were very busy (all those mojitos take a while to make). Our bill came out to about $88 including tip for two people... not bad. However, I doubt I'll be back for the food. Ca a might be a cool/chill place for happy hour but there are better places around town for tapas. I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could, but 'm rounding up.",1,3,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,review,0

The scallops were chewy and fishy and the ceviche's ingredients had a bad mixture of texture. The chicken flat bread was sparse. The salad was served the same way as coleslaw and bacon wrapped dates were greasy (goat cheese sauce tasted like sour cream). The meatballs dish was the only dish that we liked. I also ordered a glass of wine and it looked like it was two ounces. Our meal ended up being $74 and we were beyond disappointed.

We ordered cocktails and our food, we ordered their Meatballs, Spring Rolls, Mac & Cheese, and the Dates. We ordered these because they're are favorites from Firefly so we could compare.

The drinks are consistent, the food is so fresh and flavorful..each and every time!  The weather is warming up so we are definitely looking forward to some warm nights on the patio.  They have a little lounge patio area with a few cushy seats that almost seems like my own private little living room.  Perfect!

This visit Cory (owner) stopped by the table and he gave us some previews of drinks he is creating for the summer menu. (Which by the way is a selling point to this ADHD foodie...new stuff on the menu is a big plus)  I can't talk too much about the spicy, savory, tasty drinks we tried but let's just say one of them bit me!  There is also a new Sangria on the menu which is so refreshing and not too sweet.  Made with a Malbec and citrus juices (and Bacardi O) it is going to be the perfect complement to a warm Vegas breeze, swaying palm trees and ceviche.  

Speaking of ceviche we tried the Mushroom Ceviche.  I think it was made with Beech Mushrooms.  Those were new for me.  They were soaking in a citrus marinade that made raw mushrooms absolutely tasty.  We also had the Spicy Tuna Ceviche and the Mixto made with shrimp, scallops, and calamari (they have an 'choose 3' offer that we couldn't resist).  The 3 of those along with the Hamachi was almost enough for us.  

But even before the ceviches were ordered I could smell the aroma of truffle coming from the table next to us (and NO I am not sick of truffles yet)...so what did we have to try? The new Truffle Chips.  Um, HELLO, I need a whole bag of those right now!  Thin crispy waffle cut potato chips with grated parmesan and truffle oil.  You know how some of us like the really brown potato chips and pick them out of the bags? Well, these chips were like those on steroids.  I think I ate them all, but sorry, my eyes were closed and I was in Heaven so I don't really remember.

Things to try: the Watermelon Ginger Margharita, the new Sangria, and the freakin' awesome Truffle Chips!

First off, their happy hour prices are so inexpensive!! I posted pictures of the menus- beer $3, Cocktails 4.50, and a glass of wine for $3.50? Absolutely awesome.

The watermelon gazpacho was pleasing, but the flavours weren't really intermingled well. One bite would be incredibly delicious, and the next sort of bland. I definitely wouldn't write it off though.

Our cocktails were the highlight; my father had Fire Water which was a really unique concoction that included Ctristal Aguardiente, a Columbian liquor. The Diablo Dulce was exactly that, spicy and sweet- and utterly satisfying. The Sugarcane sangria was really good, and really sweet; I asked our waitress and from her description of its ingredients, -maybe it should be called High Fructose Corn Syrup Sangria. Sierra Mist is the contributing sweetness : /

There was also an interesting selection of South American Beers!

My preliminary explanation is that people love sugar cane in their drinks; they love it so much that they are driven in a sugar frenzy to giving 4 or more stars. I can respect this. I didn't have any sugar cane drinks. I had a glass of wine and some food.

The atmosphere is dark and sexy and suave, and I do love a good atmosphere, but at Cana you pay for the atmosphere. The food was expensive for tapas. We had a ceviche, which was decent. I had no real complaints there, but some of my friends did not think it was the freshest. Then we had an $11 chicken flatbread. For $11, I expected some mega-chicken and assorted toppings, but there were maybe 9 little cubes of chicken and close to no mango that was promised on the menu. Not cool. The yucca frites were not too special, and the ""crispy"" $12 shrimp were not crispy at all. They were a bit soggy. Plus, most everything came to the table not hot. I hate not hot tapas.  

I am willing to grant that perhaps I came on an off night. There was a manager type who appeared to be running dishes, when generally that is a task reserved for the waitstaff. If I am at Town Square and someone wants to go back, I wouldn't be a party pooper. However, for now and based on the other reviews, I would say go to Cana for the drinks, but eat at Firefly.

We started first of course with some drinks. My boo ordered a strawberry basil margherita....when I asked her if she liked it she simply replied ""this shit is hella good, I'm getting another!!"" I order a cucumber mojito...I like a stiff drink but mine was a little rough....I won't judge it on that as I'm sure every other one they make is excellent. I sent mine back and had it replaced with the diablo dulce. It was different it had some rum pineapple juice habenero and garlic....I'm sure there was some other stuff but I'm a little fuzzy writing this at the moment.
We went on to order the chicken empanadas....they were excellent....get them....they were the perfect amount of flaky and crunchy....not too much oil....after that we had the spicy tuna chiviche....it was good as well....big chunks of. We had the ""hamachi"" as well...that was excellent....cut like sashimi but cooked in citrus juice. We were up for more....we decided to ask rauqel what she liked....she said the dates....I said no thanks we are already on one haha (that was corny but who cares its fun)...we ordered the dates and calamari.....the dates were awsome...super sweet and wrapped in bacon....that calamari was just calamari....not too special...we finished off with the short rib tacos......if you decide to visit ca a order those for sure....they are good....we were stuffed.....good food, good atmosphere,  and pretty unique drinks......its all reasonable tapas pricing too....go to townsquare and try it if you haven't before.

Chicken Skewers
Piggy Back Dates

They need some sort of sign of life out front. We went here on a week night thinking it was Happy Hour menu. There were 3 of us. We ordered a ton of food wanting to try it all. And thinking Happy hour pricing. The server was training someone. You could tell they had both been drinking already. There were 3 tables in the restaurant and it was freezing in there. I wore my winter coat through the whole meal and still my teeth were chattering. The dynamic duo weren't sure if the the Beef Tenderloin Tiradito was available. We ordered Ceviche, tuna, dates, sliders, and short ribs, plus the beef tenderloin which we did not know if it was coming or not until it arrived. Usually tapas comes a few things at a time. Here it took forever and then BAM, it was all on the table. I have to say everything was delicious. I refused to share the beef tenderloin. The Sangria was very good too. After we ate we couldn't take anything as it doesn't travel well. So, don't overorder. The check came and we were surprised at the amount. My daughter had just been there the week before and they had Happy hour pricing at the time we were there. We asked the waitress what was going on with the check. She gave a long winded story about new specials and hours for Christmas shoppers. And went on forever, about lunch specials. Finally, we think she said they had changed the Happy Hours and we had missed it by 5 minutes. I know, we should have asked. But it is also good customer service to say ""sorry you just missed Happy Hour"". Especially since it changed from the previous week. We would have ordered the same anyway. It's the point that of all the 1000's of places in Vegas, we went there for food and Happy Hour. I am undecided if I will return. The service is the lowest. But the food is really good. For sure it won't be until summer. I hate eating in a winter coat. Maybe by summer they will have better service and people watching?",1,3,8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA,review,1

The waitress that brought our food was different from the one who took our order, so seemed confused when I pointed out the steak was missing.

The owners of this place own several places in town, some great and some ok, so they obviously could care less what I had to say.  It is about the food!  If you make great food then people will come.

I am a sucker for trying every new place around, despite the countless bad reviews I read.  Cabo''s was the latest of the new places I've tried.  Was the food horrible?  No, the food was not horrible.  Was the restaurant dirty?  No, the restaurant was actually very clean and nicely decorated..  Was the service bad?  No, the service was ok.  

If nothing was horrible then why the two stars?  There are countless Mexican establishments in Champaign/Urbana and I've eaten at every one of them.  I would go eat at any of the good ones before going back here. The menu didn't contain 200 items like many of the other establishments, which I found kind of refreshing.  However, the prices were crazy high for Mexican food.  They charge $13.00 for a Fajita and $3.00 more if you want meat such as chicken or steak on it.  That is $16 for a Fajita that would be $9-$12 everywhere else.  

The food was not horrible, but it was bland.  The fajitas lacked flavor.  I had to salt and pepper it to make it taste like something.  When have you ever had to add salt and pepper to a Mexican dish after it has been served?  If the answer is more than zero then you've likely eaten at Cabo's or another bad Mexican restaurant. 

The service consisted of countless college aged students of European decent.  I scanned the staff and didn't see one person that appeared to come from a Mexican background.   This is usually a worrisome sign for me at any ethnic restaurant, particularly at a Mexican restaurant.  This place could be Mexican-American owned and operated, but I doubt it.  The employees I encountered were pleasant, but the experience was nothing special.  Before you bash me as some white hating individual I must disclose that I'm white.  I also believe that my fellow fair skinned man can cook good ethnic food, but rarely is it ever as good as a person from that particular ethnic background (in this case Mexican). 

With all the other Mexican establishments in town why would I eat here again?  I won't, I'll take my business and money elsewhere where I can get a better meal for less.  If you must try it then go ahead as it won't be a horrible experience, but don't say that you weren't warned.",0,2,1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w,review,0

John, the general manager, was professional and very friendly upon my initial inquiry and throughout the meal. My group ate in the small area to the right just inside the main door.

The service? It could not have been better. Angela and Joy spoke with me prior to the arrival of the other guests to make sure that everything was set up properly and to make sure that the guests would get the best possible service. They did a great job of getting drinks and food orders, offering suggestions, and generally having fun with the diners. Chips and drinks were refilled quickly and all the service was with a smile.

Everyone enjoyed their meal. We ordered quite an array of entrees from tacos to fajitas. My meal, the stuffed poblano pepper, was excellent. Angela suggested adding spicy pork to it, but I was determined to have a meat-free meal today. The next time I will definitely try her suggestion. I thought the queso we ordered for our chips was outstanding. People gobbled up the fresh guacamole, which I personally thought needed just a bit more heat. The other suggestion one person made was that his meal also could have used a bit more heat. Needless to say, everyone left quite full and satisfied.

We stopped in for an early dinner. We left filled and satisfied.  The food was very good and we will definitely be back. We had cheese curds as an appetizer. They were tasty, but they are breaded and then deep fried and served with a sauce. The sauce was a wonderful tomato-jalapeno-fruit sauce (can't fully identify the fruit), and it may have some roasted red pepper.  Truly good sauce.  The curds themselves were unexceptional. Too much breading, but that seems common in this part of the country.  (We prefer curds warm and ""naked"" with a spice ""rub"" rather than a sauce. But I'm not complaining. They were good.)

The main courses likewise were really good. The pork tacos had ample seasoned pork, cilantro, onions, and (oddly) sour cream. But the mix of flavors was very good, and I added the green salsa (that came with the chips) to mine.  The squash tacos were a real surprise, especially at a restaurant like this. They were spicy and perfectly done. Both taco dishes came three to a plate on soft corn tortillas.  The crisp was billed as a Mexican pizza-- a flour tortilla filled with cheese and toppings. Not quite a tostada, so Mexican pizza is probably as good a description as any.  It was piled high and easily shared. And, most important, it was delicious.

The chips and salsa were good. The salsa, in fact, was very good. Especially the hot salsa. It was a tomatillo salsa but with lots of peppers but still not really hot.  The red salsa was billed as mild, and it was. None in our party found it exceptional.  The chips were warm and very salty. I couldn't tell for certain, but I don't believe they are made on the premises.  

The menu is relatively large and broad, ranging from tilapia to steak to tacos and burritos. And there are many choices in each category. Carnivores and vegetarians both will find things on the menu, though vegan vegetarians may not find much.  It isn't really Mexican; if you are looking for authentic Mexican you should go to Maize or El Charro. The food here is Mexican Inspired. I'm not knocking it. It is delicious. The steaks and seafood with Mexican spices were amazing, and they have a greater variety of tacos than do the more authentic places. The chefs may have worked in a steakhouse as they really know how to cook the steaks.  And the spices and sauces add to the flavors rather than smothering or overwhelming the meats or vegetables. 

The place has one other feature that many of our Mexican style restaurants lack: a lovely decor. Although says Cantina and Grill on the sign, this is a sit-down restaurant if you want it to be.  On the side away from the bar it has normal tables, while the bar area has service at the bar and at those ""tall tables"" that require high chairs to sit at.  The decor is simple but very nice, the music was quite low and we could easily talk over it.  There are several TVs and I suspect it serves as a nice sports bar on game days.  

The wait staff was wonderful. They would explain any dish you might have questions about, and they make recommendations if you give them guidelines about what you are looking for in a meal.  Very professional and amazing given that they've only been open for a week.  

Parking is ample and we were seated immediately. The waitress took our drink order less than five minutes after we were seated, and the drinks arrived promptly, as did the chips and salsa, and both were refilled quickly and without our needing to ask.

All in all, I think this place is off to a great start in Champaign! I suspect it will become one of our regular stops.",1,5,1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w,review,0

When I took my first bite of the pork taco, there were so many flavors bursting in my mouth! It was spicy and juicy! Pork was cooked so perfectly! My mouth was definitely in heaven. Next, I had the most amazing spinach salad. There was a mild curry flavor and the tangerines and onions made it so crisp and fresh! That has been the best salad I have ever had. But I have to say, that the winner of it all for me at least is the sauce that came with the cheese curds. I am calling it the ""Magic Sauce"". I hope the owners would start bottling that sauce and having it for sale. I would definitely stock my pantry up with it. 
What I liked most is the variety they had. I even had a fabulous burger that was mildly spiced and had a cumin type flavor to it.

I went there for lunch with some co-workers.  The man who seated us seemed to be annoyed that we came in.  The bartender has to come wait on us because the rest of the staff just stood around talking.  Overall the service wasn't that great.  We were then brought two kinds of salsa that we were told were made ""in house so they are extra yummy.""  The salsa had no flavor.  Was very unimpressed and disappointed.

They have no lunch menu.  Everything is one price/one size.  This was disappointing.

I ordered the chicken burrito.  My co-worker had ordered the spicy pork burrito, and the third person decided not to eat because she was so put off by the who situation.

The burrito came out and looked good, but boy was I wrong.  They use black beans, which tasted like they were from a can and not washed off.  They tasted like they had been sitting in some sort of brine solution.  There was rice, which had no flavor either.  The rice they serve seemed a bit over cooked, had corn in it, and was very bland.  Basically they take a couple tortillas, spread some cheese on it, then rice, beans lettuce and the chicken.  They then ""grill"" it.  The lettuce was wilted and soggy.  Gross.  I cut the whole thing in half to eat the chicken.  It was the best part, but that's not saying much.  The chicken was salty...VERY SALTY.  I took the rest home thinking that I might be able to salvage it or give a bit to my dog, but it smelled so incredibly bad that I just threw the whole thing out at home.

LVMdHcurRep_3F0yO6jv3A,gF37cxBOnIi3ZoC6FKmu-Q,2014-01-20,3,"Champaign is full of middling but not terrible places for Mexican food. You get your food in seconds, but it's pretty much just the same ingredients shuffled around in different combinations, and each component is not all that great. Not BAD, but not great. I think this is the first truly great place for Mexican I've eaten at in Champaign, which is why I'm throwing caution to the wind and actually giving it a full five stars.

I just started going a few weeks ago, and I've been there three times since. I've always found the wait staff to be really pleasant. They do get pretty busy during dinner, but I've never had a terrible wait and usually get seated right away. It might help that I tend to eat dinner a little earlier, if possible.

You get chips and salsa, of course, to start at no charge. Their chips were fresh and light and warm. Nothing is a bad sign like bad tortilla chips at a Mexican restaurant. I have tried the guacamole and the queso. Of the two, I preferred the queso as an add-on dip for the Nachos. The guacamole was okay, but it could have used more lime, and I prefer my guac a bit chunkier.

Possibly the best thing on their menu are their crisps, which are like little mini-pizzas on a tortilla-based ""crust."" The crust of them is perfect. Delicate and flaky and crispy, which you'd hope based on the name. I've had bites of two different crisps-the pork and the red pepper varieties. I preferred the pork overall, but both were full of flavor. Their cheese and sauces seem of a very good quality and are very flavorful.

I've also tried their pork tacos. The tortillas uses for their tacos (white corn, I believe) are great. Soft, with a little bit of texture and tooth to them. I did think their pork could used a tad more heat, but other than that they made a good lunch portion with the chips.

Desert-wise, you must try their fried ice-cream! It's the best I've ever had. It seems like a hard thing to mess up too badly, but plenty of Mexican places that bother to offer it, do. It has a sweet, flaky crust and delicious chocolate drizzle. It might be nice if you got two coated, smaller scoops of ice cream instead of one larger one, just to balance out the crust and ice cream proportions a bit better. Still, it's delicious.

As far as drinks go, I have had two of their Margaritas. The first was a Blackberry and Basic concoction, and was my favorite of the two. I didn't get a ton of basil from it, but there was enough there to make it interesting. The other was a pineapple and coconut Margarita. This had a great taste, though I didn't get much coconut from it other than the toasted coconut on the rim of the glass. Neither skimped on the alcohol.",0,5,1DedueD53YsKcpqMWPIe9w,review,0

Food: HOLF SH*T SALTY. I mean SALTY. Like hey, want some food as a side to your jug of morton's salt with that? Now, I am not one of those people on a low sodium diet, where you body goes into shock consuming salt. I consider myself having a pretty normal diet. The guacamole was salty. Black beans couldn't even taste beans because it was sooo salty. Rice was mushy and had no flavor at all. I tried my husband's chicken burrito, and it was salt with chicken essence. We wouldn't even bag it up for our dogs to eat. I had the cheese enchiladas. HORRIBLE. It was like a really bad quesadilla with some red sauce on it. No use of Mexican cheeses-- just really shitty kraft cheese that my knife wouldn't even cut through. 

Service: Meh. Had to ask the bartenders for menus as no one was coming to our table. Server was new and didn't know the menu when we had a couple questions. When she saw that I only ate a bite of my food, she didn't ask if there was anything wrong or how she could fix it. Big no no. I was a server for 5 years and you just know when something isn't right with your customers. 

Drinks: Meh. I had the blackberry margarita, which tasted of only blackberry syrup. Needed to be cut with fresh lime juice. 

We left with both of us wanting to throw up and head to the sauna to sweat out the salt. Seriously eating bad Chinese food and a bunch of sunflower seeds would still be less salt than this place.

Once we ordered then we waited what seemed like a very long time to get our food.  The food was not edible.  The black beans were chalky and cold and had a funny flavor.  They serve the Chimichanga with rice and beans on the outside and on the inside.  I ordered a chicken Chimichanga but all that was in it was rice and beans and not very good rice and beans either!  

I ordered a classic margarita and it was good but it's about a 4 ounce glass and cost $7.  Get real!!!!

The inside is really nice (just like Smoke Que and Brew) but the service and the food suck!  I will not go back for a second try to this place.

The menu is just great.  Lets talk drinks first.  I'm definitely a margarita lover so having Cabo's wide selection was awesome! Instead of regular sour mix they make fresh lime juice and organic agave nectar! How cool! The Roasted Blackberry and Basil Margarita by far is delicious. This combo goes great together.  However, my personal favorite is the Platinum Margarita. Instead of Triple sec, this one calls for a high quality and tasty ingredient called Grand Marnier--it makes the flavor so much better!

So food. To start off, the chips and salsa must be good at a Mexican place, and this place surely scores a 10 by me! The stuffed poblano is really what hits the spot for me, but I do love a good taco! And this is definitely the place for that!

On my last trip here, I came with some friends to get some food in our systems before/during/after beers. We all three ordered the meal which consisted of a slice of pizza, a delicious side, and a drink. In my case, I got a pepperoni pizza, toasted mini potatoes, and a Pepsi. I should mention that they had like 5 different kids of pizza ready to serve up (pepperoni, ham/pineapple, cheese, sausage, jalapeno, stuffed...) which they warm up for you really quickly before serving it. As for the quality of my pizza? It was good. It was nothing to write home about, but it was good. I think the crust was kinda bland, but otherwise I was happy with it. The little potatoes they served me were pretty good, too. My friends ordered the pasta on the side, and they were happy with their food selections as well. As a matter of fact, they were happy enough with their sides that they ate them before the pizza and said it was a 5-star meal, though I was erring on the side of 3. (Thus the four-star rating)

Service here is always pretty quick and simple. Prices are ok (I paid like 7.80 for the meal, which is pretty good for the amount of food!) I'll keep coming back here when I'm in the Texas, for sure!",0,4,1J69KdlcuXRMCyOFqtQNgg,review,0

After reviewing the menu I decided to try something 'safe' so I ordered the meat loaf with mashed potatoes and gravy.  The meat loaf had very little seasoning, if any.  It had an odd taste.  It also appeared to be overcooked around the edges.  There was quite a 'crust' on it.  Overall, not appetizing at all.  The 'mashed' potatoes were quite lumpy.  I had to finish mashing them with the fork.  It appeared they had been mashed quickly, possibly just before they were served.  Again, lack of seasoning, particularly salt.  Not good at all.   I didn't finish either item.

And when I tried to pay my check, there was no one at the register.  I probably stood there about 3 minutes before another customer got in line behind me.  She finally summoned a waiter and asked if we could pay our bills.  The response was, ""I don't know where she is.""  He then disappeared for a moment and then returned and said ""She will be with you in a minute.""   Not good customer service.

The whole meal was not very good.  While the price was reasonable, the food didn't live up to the hype that I received.  I don't think I would either recommend this place or go there again.

But, here is the best part was the dressing came in a squeeze package like the ones at fast food places.  The meatloaf was horrible but strangely the mashed potatoes were good.  The fried chicken was OK. They make it with honey so chicken is very sweet and not something I'd eat again.  The fries were typical frozen french fries but were OK.  

If the food wasn't disappointing enough, all of the servers had bad attitudes and it showed.  We could hear all the talk from the kitchen since we were so close.

Typical convenient store, with a nice hot kitchen with plenty to choose from... Pizza by the slice, whole pizzas, chicken, subs, etc.

First trip: we each had the Italian sub (hot) and split an order of chicken tenders & jojos.  The Italian subs were great!  We were more than impressed.  For an Italian sub, it was as good as it gets.  The jojos were decent... Good size, ok flavor.  The tenders left much to be desired... Too bland for our liking.

Second trip: we each had the Italian subs (of course!) and split a snack pack (4 whole wings & 2 jojos).  the subs, they were as good as the first time!  These subs are probably 8"", not the biggest but, big enough and with great flavor!  The jojos were as they were the first time but the wings were delicious!  Much more flavor then the tenders.

You can either order a pizza or sub or you can take advantage of their hot and ready pizza by the slice. There is a sign on the deli cooler that says if you spend $20 in groceries you get a free pizza. I'm not sure if that's for any grocery items in the store or only items from the deli. 

I have been going here for years and there have been a lot of different employees over the last 10 years. I have never had a bad customer experience at this location though. The staff is always very friendly. Especially for some of the people they put up with on a daily basis since this place isn't in the best area. 

I do highly recommend this place for the pizza by the slice if you aren't too uppity to visit a store in a low income area. There are some sketchy looking characters around sometimes but nobody has ever bothered me in the 10 years I've been going there. Everybody just minds their own business and moves on just as it should be.

The two people I've encountered working there are the friendliest people you'll meet. The young man is the cashier and the older lady works the kitchen. They make a great team.

The kitchen serves up hot, made to order pizzas (also available by the slice), subs, fried chicken, and jojos at very reasonable prices!  Fellow Yelper, Darren R has been raving about the delicious Fiery Gauntlet sub for a while and he has reason to because that sammich and the Italian sub I've tried have been really tasty!  They come loaded with savory deli meat and cheese sliced fresh in house with fresh, crisp lettuce, tomato, and onion finished with a smidgen of creamy Italian dressing, nicely toasted on a seasoned hoagie roll...all for around $4-$5.49.  
I've had the pizza by the slice and it's pretty good at $1.69 for one slice or $2.99 for two slices!  You can order a whole pizza any way you'd like it too.

ghuU8vusxnrSc30gF7e-oQ,javH5G2S3JihyfbBsfJQLg,2015-03-10,0,"I was lost somewhere around Queen street in a snowstorm with a gurgling, uneasy feeling in my stomach when I came across this place. All it took was the words ""Churrasqueira"" on the sign to convince me to step inside and abandon my plans of going to the gym. I'd never heard of a Churrasqueira before, but it sounded kinda like ""Carniceria,"" which always means good food.

I parked my bike in front of a be-toqued hobo and crossed the threshold. This place is the real deal. Boisterous olive skinned people (the Portugese?) conversed loudly with each other across piles of chicken and glasses of red wine. A baba-from-the-old-country-looking lady sat in a corner, monologuing to a group men standing around in jackets and scarves. Everyone seemed like they belonged here, like they either worked for the place or were related to someone who did. Some hilarious over-the-top foreign soap opera played in the corner, unwatched.

About the time when I was starting to feel out of place, this sweet girl behind the counter grabbed my attention and set me at ease with a good old ""hi there, let me know if you have any questions!"" I ended up ordering the half chicken special, the words leaving my mouth slow and gummy due to the fact that my lips were still frozen. I'd hoped I made a good first impression, because this girl became my rock. Within two minutes of stepping into this place I felt like I had been dropped into another country and I was gonna need a friend.

Initially, I had planned to grab the food and go, but the ambience was so pleasant that I decided to stay, even if that meant eating dinner in a restaurant by myself while being scrutinized by locals. I pulled out this new neuroscience book that I'd been hoping to read and got to work on it; waitress girl brought out some bread and butter. Ahhhh yeaa, I was gonna make of night of this.

Before I knew it, the chicken dinner arrived. The thing was huge, one of those classic big Italian dinner plates piled high with salad, spherical potatoes, chicken, and dipping sauce. It was truly the biggest pile of food I'd ever seen at a restaurant in Toronto.

The chicken was fantastic. Rubbed with salt and some interesting combination of spices. It was totally worth breaking this week-long vegetarian streak I'd been on. The potatos, too, were remarkable: salty, roasty, and inherently satisfying. However, the best part of the dish was the piri piri sauce. This stuff (which waitress girl later informed me was handmade made in house), had the perfect balance of heat, acidity, and flavor. It also had a fair bit of creaminess that really rounded out the flavor of the potatoes.

All too soon, the chicken was gone and I was stuffed. I felt truly good. Not even the thought of having to bike through the snow could put a damper on my chicken-fortified spirit. I'd had a good meal, made some progress on this book, and found a cool new place to eat where I felt welcome. I think the waitress even called me cute at the end there. Ahh yeaa.",0,5,2H5EaBEreDzzP7sPmD_oDQ,review,0

Tasty and good value?  Definitely!

This completely unassuming super authentic Portuguese place is located in currently trendifying and hipsterfying part of Dundas West between Bathurst and Ossington.  Decor is minimal with a TV.  Expect to see lots of Portuguese families in this casual, casual joint.

The FOOD was all decent with some hits and misses.  The grouper was quite tasty, although we weren't sure that it was actually grouper.  The half chicken was probably the best dish of the night and came with a delightfully spicy dipping sauce.  The steak, which I ordered medium rare,  was served on the well done side of well done; however, the flavor was actually good.  I don't get why places ask about steak temperatures if it's not going to make a difference anyway.  Fries were pretty limp.

SERVICE was friendly and very casual.  Definitely not a place to come if you're in a rush.  The food took a long time to come out, but the free bread and olives helped with the wait.

Es liegt nur ca. 20 Gehminuten von S-Hoffeld entfernt. Das Geb ude geh rt wohl irgendwie zum TSV Birkach der dort diverse Sport-st tten betreibt. Vermutlich war es mal die Vereinsgast tte.  berbleibsel finden sich in der teilweise  bernommenen Inneneinrichtung wieder u.a. (hellbraune Holztische)

Der (gemischte) Salat wurde vorab auf einem kleinen Teller mit Dressing serviert. 
Er  berzeugte durch seine Frische, kein Billigkraut aus dem 10-Liter-Eimer, bis auf die Gurkenscheiben, die wohl schon l nger aufgeschnitten rumlagen. Das Steak wurde kurz drauf aufgetischt.

My mom, 2-year-old, and I dropped into John's on a Wednesday at 10:30. I was pleased at how quiet and drowsy it was inside, yet we still got greeted enthusiastically and the waitress tended to us right away. Something tells me that if we were to come in at the same time on a Saturday, it would have been packed, but we would have still been acknowledged and served in an efficient manner. It's just that type of place and seems to be run really smoothly.

Two things I was surprised about: their corned beef hash is, like, REAL. No crap out of a can (though I will always hold a special place in my heart for that salty gruel). It tasted great and came out fast. The second thing: they have a sign on the table boasting their own root beer made with cane sugar. I hate root beer, but that's pretty impressive.

 My daughter had a short stack of blueberry hotcakes and we had more than half left over because they were huge and hearty. My mom requested that her omelette be made with egg whites only, and they did that with no problem. 

The coffee wasn't AMAZING, but it was better than average, hot, and the refills kept coming. Our waitress was attentive without being intrusive.

Much of the inside is original - booths, counter, stools, hat racks, etc. Food is good, standard diner fare. Nothing outstanding but still solid. My friend says their pancakes are the best she's ever had. I've never had them as I'm not much of a pancake eater, but she's a connoisseur so I'll take her word for it. As for cleanliness - I've definitely eaten in cleaner joints. I've never been in the bathroom, not even sure if they have one. Also, I wouldn't look at the floor if I were you...

The reason John's gets 4 and not 3, is they have what I call a great 'diner waitress'. A great diner waitress is somebody who is very efficient, never misses anything, and always keeps your coffee hot. She calls you 'hun' or 'sweetie' but it somehow isn't patronizing like it is when other people say it. Don't know her name and she's very young but she is great and is always there. 

John's is a classic type place - looks rough on the outside, not too far behind on the inside, but will serve you up a good, hot meal quickly and cheaply.  Oh, yeah - CASH ONLY.",2,4,-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ,review,0

tjT9ehEn00wR-cCZcUdo-A,a1x5xhZ2zpBdOfqtH9x-Kg,2008-12-20,5,"I like a restaurant that doesn't really care about me.  Too many restaurants slink around your ankles like beaten dogs, cravenly asking, ""Do you want anything, sir?  Please?  Yes, I can get it for you, restaurant-Gollum loves the master, we adoreses you...""

John's Diner will serve you, but on its own terms.  They treat you like people; they're happy to see you, but they've been around for fifty years and will be around for fifty more.  The waitresses tell you what's going on in the back, complain merrily about the job, bring your food to you, pat you on the shoulders.  They have that quiet pride that says, ""If you behave well, you're part of the family here.  If not, here's the door.""  I didn't ask for anything special, but one suspects that if I asked them for, say, a pomegranate-infused soda, they'd look at me sternly and go, ""Now, what did you want THAT for?""

As such, it's supremely pleasant atmosphere.  This is a classic DINER diner, a long narrow train tube with a row of stools for the quick eaters and beat-up booths in the back, where the scents waft out of the kitchen behind the counter.  

The food?  Well, as Gini notes, they put the greasy in greasy spoon, but that's actually part of the charm; they don't care about eating healthy, they want you to eat hearty.  They have all the greatest diner hits, from eggs and bacon to open-faced turkey sandwich, and the food is not exceptional but it is home-made and fills you up quite nicely on a low budget.

Would I recommend this to my snooty foodie friends?  No.  But would I take them here the morning after a night out for comfort food?  You betcha.  Would I go here myself when I'm tired of exotic foods and just want a damn sandwich?

It is also the weirdest dining experience I have experienced in all my years...

So I've driven by quite a few times and it struck me as a place the locals go when they've had one too many or maybe a place some of the locals frequent for a weekend hangover cure. 

To preface this, I'm under the impression that things were going through a change on this first and last visit here. There were items hand-written into the menu, the elderly waitress made a comment that the ""chef"" was new, and the register was brand new to the waitress as well. 

So, anyhow, the story:
Two adults and one child (age of 5). Empty diner except one elderly gentleman who showed up while we were there. The establishment was dirty....don't care. I actually expected it and may have been disappointed had it not been. The waitress needs to retire. She seemed to be struggling stringing sentences together a little. Still, not a big deal. 

Let's order!

So the child of our bunch ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, the adults meals were roast beef and mashed potatoes and gravy as well as swedish meatballs over noodles. 

Each meal came with the soup of the day (a creamy spinach soup with whatever those noodles are in wedding soup). I ordered the chili on top of that just to have a taste. The chili was GROSS! Not like a gross like this is too sweet, or too salty, or just not a good recipe....it was GROSS in a way that can only be described as it seemed as though it was so old and re-used or SOMETHING that it developed a taste of nothing with the consistency of cream of wheat. 

The soup of the day came out.....again.....GROSS!!!! Gross for the same reasons except this also had the added pleasure of tasting like they ""of the dayified"" the soup pot by adding a block of salt. VERY gross. I eat EVERYTHING no matter what. I dd NOT eat this.

Spaghetti comes out. Giant portion for a kid but one can't complain about that. Sad-looking but no bog whoop. She enjoyed it.....she's 5. 

The roast beef and mashed potatoes come out. Immediately I see those scooped, starchy, obviously flake potatoes.....no big whoop. Not my cup of tea but they can;t be that bad. The roast beef, however, looked (and I tasted it) and tasted HORRIBLE! It had a gray tinge to it, had the appearance of a texture closer to pencil shavings (only larger) and there was literally zero moisture left in it at all. Gross but let's press on.

While that was going on, I heard the waitress speak to the ""chef"" and explained that the Swedish Meatballs over noodles uses egg noodles and not spaghetti noodles and moreover (she didn't use that word I assure you) the ""sauce"" is a brown gravy and not marinara sauce. There was some kind of muttering of acknowledgement and the waitress let me know that there was a problem and that my meal would be out shortly. 

The ""chef"" tried to give me the exact same thing the child across from me had and call it ""Swedish Meatballs Over Noodles""!!!! Wrap your brain around that! So, after a brief lapse, the plate comes out....unbeknownst to me half my plate had spilled onto the counter during transport and the waitress had used a couple spools to get it back onto my plate before giving it to me. MMMMMMMMM!!!!! Then I look down. It's the same meatballs sitting across from me, the same spaghetti noodles (not egg noodles) sitting across from me with the same brown gravy sitting across from me.....ok, I'm not a debutante...I'll tough it out. 

I sliced into the first meatball. I took a bite. It was nearly frozen in the center had a salty briny taste from the gravy that also seemed spoiled. It was gross. The very first time in my years I just pushed a plate away and refused to eat it. 

The waitress came over shortly after and asked how everything was. I let her know that I will kindly pay for these meals but would not feed these things to a stray dog. I let her know this was the first time I ever said this dining out. 

She asked if she could take something off the check? First off, the right thing to do is to just apologize and comp the meal....I wasn't about to debate what should be taken off, get into a mathematics quiz with someone who seems confused that she is even working at a restaurant (again, no offense but she just needs to stop). 
So we all got up and walked toward the register. This is how we found out that the register is new......
So I was charged a little over 20 bucks. I handed the waitress 2-20s and asked if I could just have a 10 back. This was a problem. She could figure out how to open the drawer or use it in any way. She talked to it in disdain and was even starting to have that same kind of demeanor Kathy Bates had in Misery. Losing it to say the least. I felt bad at first but then she started to smack the register each time a button press was unsuccessful....kinda in a way when you first find out your girl is a little bit kinky but you aren't quite sure what that means.",1,1,-K_qGSp7q61BkkjP_FSsEQ,review,8

We both added hash browns for $1.25. I got coffee and orange juice. He got lemonade and $2 stuffed grape leaves (which were the worst we've ever had.)

Nancy, the owner, looked at him and apologetically said ""I'm sorry, sir - that is the cookie she chose and I cannot serve that cookie to anyone else now.  You can buy a blueberry muffin if you'd like.""

This made me think two things: 1 - I'm glad they will not reserve food like that but 2 - perhaps they should have asked if the cookie was bad, etc... and maybe even done so much as to give them a muffin to make them happy?

Sign me up...

Three of us went for lunch and got sandwiches. My cousin, a 19-year-old macho man terrorizing much of the Phoenix female population currently, got the chicken salad sandwich. He liked it a lot. It was piled high with mayonnaisy (how in the heck should I spell that, sorry) looking chopped chicken. My boyfriend got the roast beef sandwich with cheese and roasted red peppers. He thought it was pretty good, but picked off the red peppers. I tried one, and could see why they wouldn't really fit with the rest -- really pungent tasting, would totally overwhelm and stand out from the other flavors. I got the half sandwich/half salad combo with the thanksgiving turkey sandwich (cranberry spread, yum) on whole wheat, house salad. Eh, just ok. Nothing special.

We became intimately familiar with it when we lived for nearly a year up in a  Grayhawk apartment, waiting for our condo renovation to be completed.  I love the egg dishes (try the Chicago omelet), the salads (Trifecta rocks), pastries made in-store (the black-and-whites are good, and the fat-free blueberry muffins are better than the regular ones--all are usually refrigerated, though, so you may want to ask for your muffin to be heated before serving) and the bagels have the perfect bite and chewiness (contrast with the bagel-shaped bread that Einstein's churns out).  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have found the owner's family to be quite friendly and quick to recognize regulars.

Seating is sketchy during peak hours, although, for a relatively small strip-center establishment, there are a decent number of tables in and outside.  As a first-timer, remember to ask the wait staff at the door to give you a number corresponding with an open table.  You will need this when placing your order at the counter.

There was a TON of seating outside, and I remarked to my wife that Kashman's is probably the place to go on the weekend's once the temps cool down...

We each ordered a coffee and the wife ordered a egg/cheddar bagelwich on an everything bagel, while I ordered the stuffed challah french toast.  There were several choices of Seattle's Best coffee at the self serve condiment bar, and I think three different types of milk.  Coffee was good.  After a few minutes the food was served to us.  My french toast (stuffed w/ cream cheese and fried) was delicious.  It was one of the dishes where I have to tell my wife that if she wants a bite she better hurry up and get it while there is some to be had.  I finished the whole thing, no problem and wish the serving size had been a touch bigger.  The only downside of the plate was the fruit that came with it.

Everything is kept really clean and the inside is really modern.

My one complaint is that in their attempt to make the interior ""modern"" the front register ended up with a curved metal railing that makes forming a line a bit confusing.

Rather than the old-style mission look, it's a rectangular building, with a modern look on the inside.  It's actually a nice place.  The staff has always been friendly, and service is usually quick as well.  They even have some high stools around some tables that make for convenient quick meals, rather than the typical fast-food style seating.  It's nice and appealing.

Sweet Tea Report: What really sets this location apart is their sweet tea.  I don't know what it is, but this Taco Bell may have some of the best sweet tea out of any restaurant in Charlotte.  Definitely any fast food restaurant, but maybe any restaurant at all.  It's that good.  Unfortunately, you have to hit it right because depending on who makes it, the tea can be good or it can be bad.  Best of luck.

I know, all you haters of Taco Bell are crying about the chicken places that have good sweet tea, but trust me on this one.  Taco Bell - or at least this taco bell - has some dang good sweet tea.  Farmer's BBQ has some good Peach Sweeet Tea, but for regular old sweet tea, I'd put this stuff up against just about anyone (if you get a good batch).

Even better is the fact that they constantly mess up the orders over and over again. I mean sometimes I just want Taco Bell and sadly this is the closest one around my house unless I want to drive forever down the road.

My friend and I were looking for lunch around 2 O'clock and stumbled upon Indian Flavour. It is right in the downtown core and hard to miss with it's huge red, vertical sign. It's a fun looking room with colourful drapes and attentive service for a buffet. 

Come lunchtime, the best option is the buffet for 10 dollars and change. For two people, they brought us one naan bread, cut in half which is a bit stingy if you ask me. Anywho, to the buffet! The salad selection is pretty miniscule. I didn't even try anything on it because they looked a bit left out. The onion baji and fried other thing were cold and didn't have the crunchiness that is so welcome in food like this. 

I applaud the order of the line-up of food. Apart from dessert towards the beginning, it is a very logical setup for putting together my plate. The food is ok at best. Butter chicken's chicken has hard, unappetizing chunks of fat on the meat with bones and the lamb curry's lamb is also very fatty in an oily sauce. We ordered more naan bread and were not charged. I liked the eggplant dish and the spinach though it could have had a lot more of the advertised cheese. The rest, and we tried a lot more, I don't really remember which is telling.

Once we established that I was going to forgo the lunch buffet ($9.99) and just have a combo of two curries ($6.99) to go, I was walked over to the buffet spread and dished out my meal. Although there were a fair number of both meat and veg options to choose from, the curries mostly looked inspired. The saag that I chose was rather bland and had only one lonely cube of paneer in it. The butter sauce (sans chicken) was a much better balance of spicy and sweet. 

While the server was visibly displeased and inconvenienced by their running out of pre-made naan at the buffet table, it must have been my my lucky day since the freshly prepared naan was definitely worth the wait.

I had a pretty good Big Smoke Burger experience on King West. I was hoping that this closer-to-home Big Smoke location would at least be good, but it was not. Unfortunately I'm not going to have my Big Smoke cravings satisfied without having to drive to Toronto. 

So I order the spicy burger combo and I watch the dude slap my patty on the grill. So far so good. I then watch the grill continuously flare up. I really had to restrain myself from being a back-seat griller and shouting out, ""Hey, buddy, how about you try controlling those flare ups, please."" I didn't want to be one of those people so I said nothing. 

I also said nothing as I continued to watch my patty shrink ever so quickly because of all the flare ups. I continued to say nothing as the dude flipped my patty over and over again when what I really wanted to do was yell at the top of my lungs, ""Dude, that patty must be done by now with all the direct fire it's received. Pull it now!"" 

Just as the dude is about to pull my patty off the grill, the other guy says, ""It's a spicy,"" so the first guy puts my surely overcooked patty back on the grill and covers it with grilled onions to warm up the onions. They left that overcooked patty with the onions on the grill for another three minutes or so as my burger loving soul died a little more. Finally he pulled the patty.

What did I end up with? A creosote covered charcoal briquette. Black on the outside, dry as MDF on the inside. I knew this was happening. I knew this was happening and I said nothing because I assumed people who are paid to cook burgers everyday know more than I and because I didn't want to be one of those people. This is what happens when you restrain yourself because you don't want to be one of those people. You end up with a dangerously  blackened (seriously dangerous, read the studies about blackened grill meats)  burger and a little of your soul dying as a good burger goes up in flames (literally!). I would have brought it back, but I was in a big rush and I didn't have time to watch them ruin another patty.

Add to that disinterested cooks and people who were behind me in line getting their food before me (always a sticking point), and you can see that I wasn't starting off on the best foot.

The signature Big Smoke burger I had was okay, but considering the price (something like $13 after tax for the combo), it's past the point where I consider it to be acceptable value for the money.

We ordered the spicy burger which had saut ed onions, lettuce,  tomato and spicy mayo. Overall, the burger was moist and had a lot of flavor. We also turned this into a combo with a poutine and a drink and to our surprise, the poutine was also amazing. Great flavor with the gravy, thick cut fries and actual cheese curds! 

Unfortunately, the only down fall with the Big Smoke Burger was the cost. After all said and done: a quaint sized burger, poutine and drink came up to a grand total of $15, hence the rating of 4 out of 5.

hYczVjw0oUxTcAPIyUgDfQ,nWijf_A0YjLSAmSrB1Nt8A,2015-06-11,1,"In the words of today's teenager: 'I can't even.' 

After a fail attempt at getting a table at Marcello's, my boyfriend's sister suggested Wild Wing as an alternative given it was within the same plaza. With a communal indifference to the dinner option after our blunder, we agreed. The warning sign should have been how empty the restaurant was with a single patron sitting at the back of the restaurant working vigilantly on her computer and nursing a beer.  The lone waitress didn't greet us, didn't nod an acknowledgment and didn't seem to give a rat's that we were there. Despite this, after deciding on a table, we sat ourselves down and patiently waited for the lone ranger to wander over. 10 minutes later, she strolled over and handed us three menus with a half assed greeting. 

Now, it's a no brainer: you come to a chicken wing place, you get something chicken related. However, I'm weird about touching my food and without fail, will always vote for the boneless option. So, you can imagine the gut sinking feeling when the waitress reappeared 15 minutes later and she advised they were out of the boneless option. 
(Why it would take 15 minutes to flip through the three page menu, [one of which consists of wing flavours to decide] in order for you to draw the conclusion that A: You want chicken. B: You want it in some variety, or C: You like to play on the wild side (see what I did there?) and stray away from the traditional by getting a burger.) (You daredevil, you.)  

Fine: I will meet your lack of boneless option and go with the chicken fingers. 

I should have taken the no boneless option as my third warning to run while I still I had a chance. 

Upon the waitresses arrival, we were greeted by plastic plates (why on earth any establishment would be serving their meals on plastic plates purchased at their local Dollarama is absolutely BEYOND ME) and quite possibly the soggiest, stalest tasting nachos. The salsa tasted rancid, and the lettuce was wilted. Upon the arrival of my entree I encountered what appeared to look like it had come straight out of a Hungry Man frozen dinner... the chicken fingers smelled off... like they'd been sitting in the back of the fridge. I was feeling ballsy, so I took a bite... I wasn't convinced. My boyfriend's GarPar chicken wings followed suit, and they were bland tasting.

20 minutes later when our waitress arrived to do a very delayed quality control check, she asked how everything was tasting. I explained to her the lack lustre experience I was having with my meal, she stared at me blankly as she asked me several times to describe how they tasted...they tasted freezer burned...they tasted off...how many other ways did I need to find in order to describe this? ""Do you want another meal made?"" No, I want to get out of here as quickly as possible...instead I asked for some more sour cream...I should have anticipated that upon her return, the sour cream would be extremely watery and very off in texture. An elderly couple helplessly attempted to flag down our waitress whom she ignored several times before the poor woman with an evident bad hip hobbled over to her requesting her attention. Given the destitute of people within the restaurant, it was easy enough to hear the woman explain that her chicken...well...it didn't taste like chicken. The waitress feigned surprise before asking: ""Does it taste like freezer burn?"" ""Yes!""

FACE PALM. 

When my boyfriend went up to settle the bill, he was started to find my meal on the bill. Upon asking if she could do something with it given my circumstances, she sighed heavily and said she'd have to consult with the kitchen staff. She returned two minutes later and said: ""I can give you 15% off."" My boyfriend now agitated by this response rebuttled that I hadn't even consumed even half of my meal."" ""Well, she ate the fries, right? I'll just charge her for those."" $4.99 on cardboard French fries later... and we were racing for the door with a mutual agreement to never return again.

It came with your choice of single sauced chicken wings (breaded/unbreaded/boneless), fries, a dipping sauce (blue cheese, ranch, sourcream, dill), celery and carrot sticks. 

I ordered the blue moonshine which was a mix of blue cheese and bbq sauce. My brother got the country girl which came dressed with their my thai sauce and pineapple. Honestly, the food took a really long time to come out but we both agreed that it tasted it pretty good compared to other well known chicken wing places. 

Our server was very friendly and helpful who did periodically check up on us but never offered us any water to start. Instead we just got the drink we ordered for the special which was a ginger ale ($2.99/unlimited).

You can definitely tell that this specific restaurant no longer anticipates for Tuesday wing eaters as the place is practically empty. The whole establishment just felt very run down and slow.

It's still juicy and I really like its sauce taste and choice.  The blue moonshine night cheese dipping for my daughter's fries is a smooth texture and just right flavour which even my wife loves that.  I think Wild Wing's wing has a quality on food in average.  Portion is ok compare to its price level.  They have kids menu and the portion is just right.

Only thing I am not quite satisfy which I can tell is the service it provide with the price.  I mean the service from getting reception to table.  The waiter told us it is around 15 min but I have waited 25 to 30min but actually the place is not that full at that time.  Well, it is me and my son's birthday, so I don't want to ruin the time.   Wait time on the food is not fast but I am patient enough along with my smartphone.

Place are big, clean but definitely a sport bar is quite noisy for family but good for a big group over 10.  Be sure you reserves for table otherwise you will be frustrated unless you want to sit in the bar side.

I think I am one of the kindest about the reviews.  I cannot say Wild Wing is very bad in food, but service wise, it needs to be improved in order impress people to come back for a second visit.

First and foremost - I really dislike brunch. Something about paying $20 for a couple of eggs and potatoes drives me nuts. But Bivy was a game-changer for me when I discovered it 2 years ago - and still insist on travelling on the weekends to go back there today! Do yourself a favour and go.

- Intimate but not crowded
- Rarely a wait
- Generous portion sizes
- I almost always order the Ploughman Platter, but have ordered their salads in the past (Farmer Salad) and was not disappointed
- I bring all my friends and guests here - many of whom ordered their Croque Monsier and raved about this plate
- Great prices

You won't regret it.


Update:

I'm not sure what happened on a recent Saturday brunch visit (March 2016). I had talked up this place to a couple of girlfriends, and convinced them to trek a little farther outside of our usual stomping grounds to meet at Bivy. Holy moly. Everything I've known about this place was flipped upside down.

- Unbearably cold in the space. Teeth chattering.
- My beloved Ploughman Platter that has been consistent for years came out so different than usual. No pate/terrine, flimsy toast, canned(?) sliced ridged pickles - what happened here!?
- My friend's Croque Monsieur (also a usual fan fave) was so salty

I've been a faithful daytime attendant for weekend brunch, weekday lunch, a coffee and a pastry-fuelled afternoon of work... I've always absolutely loved my experiences with their unbelievably friendly and attentive staff and their delicious food.

They hit it out of the park with their far ous (spinach pancakes) and omelettes, both of which I keep coming back to. I've also loved their tartiflette (potato/cheese tart) and the healthy bites I've had sharing plates of the kravitz, the ploughman, the gravlax... Basically I'm a well-meaning mooch, and my partner and I regularly wind up splitting our plates because everything is so tempting. Most of their meals come with a perfectly composed salad with mixed greens, thinly sliced radishes and a beautifully light vinaigrette and then their phenomenal potato salad...  Possibly the best I've ever had. It's definitely a step up from something you'd have at a BBQ. Everything is just really delicately balanced and flavoured just right.

Since they just launched their dinner menu, I've only tried it once, but it was one of the best meals I've ever had. Finding a decent and well-priced steak is a real difficult task in Toronto, but BIVY has it down. Their entrec te steak frites comes with a grilled 10 oz rib eye prepared at a perfect medium rare as requested and covered in an understated herbed butter, fries that are seasoned just right and done to the perfect crisp without being overcooked and, of course, that beautiful simple salad. For $18.95! Pair it with one of their well-priced glasses of wine and you have the perfect date night. We'll be back again soon, probably tacking on an order of mussels to start since they look SO good.

I know I'm just gushing at this point. I just really love this place and it's the perfect local spot. It's equal parts cafe, brunch/lunch stop and great dinner option. A lot of restaurants wouldn't be able to juggle all those identities, but BIVY is great at doing simple, delicious food and providing a versatile ambiance with great service. I'm so happy to live near by. The only problem is that I'm constantly tempted to say ""Let's just go to BIVY"" instead of, you know, cooking at home and not blowing my paycheque on daily jaunts to my favourite neighbourhood spot.",1,5,10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA,review,0
a4pWzgtEBDcVRqrrsW2tOQ,dEDId4Rp2JpblIfYIoH00w,2014-05-12,1,"Bivy is a contemporary Canadian brunch spot with a French influence. Upon entering during the day, the restaurant gives a relaxing vibe for customers to sit down and enjoy their meal or coffee. Bivy has brunch and dinner hours, which you could come in for dinner from Tuesday through Saturday. They close from 4-5 PM during those days to prepare for the evening. Bivy serves interesting dishes, such as their French spinach pancakes and their different version of the French toast (which is more of a bread pudding).

The beer served are sourced locally from Ontario. The alcoholic drinks consists of beer on tap and basic cocktails. To give back to their customers, Bivy has a policy of giving one free cup of coffee to a customer everyday. This is an awesome policy and a great way to brighten up someone's day!

I tried their Mochaccino, which is their version of a mocha and I believe cappuccino combined. It has a nutty taste to it so it is great if you like that flavour. Overall, I think Bivy is a nice spot to go to for a quick brunch with friends or your significant other during the week.",0,3,10cjlsUzS8rAKMjdEWbxvA,review,0

Ordered the Countryside Far ous: French spinach pancakes served with Montreal Smoked meat, mixed greens & potato salad 12.95 (9/10). These pancakes were Gluten free baby. Not the traditional idea of a fluffy pancake, rather more of a lightly fried spinach and egg crepe. The smoked meat served with the pancake was a bit too salty, but was easily balanced out with the fresh mixed greens and potato salad. 

My lunch companions ordered the Salads with Bivy dressing 10.75 - A generous portion of fresh greens and a balanced serving of toppings. Something I will definitely try on the next visit.

Food: 9/10 - Overall excellent food, meat was a tad too salty.

Atmosphere: 10/10 - Perfect spot for a lunch meeting. Modern d cor, spacious, plenty of seating and music volume wasn't overbearing.

Sometimes we like to do really good things, but at some point it ends up being too much; maybe we bite of more than we can chew.

The Bivy is a good spot in Little Portugal, but there is A LOT going on in this place. They serve decent coffee--not the best, not the worst--, they serve brunch and dinner, and they have a liquor license, which gives them the opportunity to sell alcohol too. This leads to an unfocused attention on certain items they may want to do better, the coffee being one of them.

I like the layout of the place. The tables and chairs seem to work well with the place and actually brighten the place up. The staff are very friendly and willing to serve everyone well.

The place is a great place, but I get the feeling they are a little confused as to what they want to be known for. Is it a great coffee place? Is it a great brunch spot? Is it a great place to get a night cap? There isn't an identity here.

Nonetheless, 3.5 stars for me because it exceeded a little bit of expectations, but could be more if they truly found their identity.

The service is decent here and we were checked on regularly and the server even shared her fav on the ICP. The food did take its time to arrive though even though the we went at off peak hours. 
The French Toast is a mini portion, it is quite good nonetheless. Raisin haters beware as they do use raisin bread. Poire Helene was just OK as I have had a lot better versions.

The interior is pretty much on par with most of the other restaurants that have popped up in this area in the last couple years, with reclaimed wood interiors with small candlelit tables. 

We started with the charcuterie and spicy devilled eggs to start. Both were tasty and appropriately priced, but the devilled eggs were admittedly not actually spicy. Still tasty, but adding a dusting of paprika is hardly spicy to me. Then as a second course we split an order of ribs, which were decent, but a little to overpowering in the citrus based acidity. 
As a main, I rounded out my meal with the pulled pork sandwich with fries. The pulled pork was admittedly less acidic than the ribs and more savoury. The spinach in the sandwich was a nice addition but the tomato and mayo just made me realize the flavor of the pork isn't impressive enough if relying on additional sauces and juicy vegetables to affect its flavouring. 

In the end for 4 beers, the 2 apps, an order of ribs and 2 mains came in a bit over $100 after tax and tip. So for what we turned into a 3 course meal, was perfectly adequate in price and results.

I told my friend that I would like to go conditionally--we could pop our heads in and if it looked okay, we could stay.

It looked okay, when checked out the place--maybe a little unpleasant, in that some of the tables were uncleared and so on, but this might just have been busyness. It was pretty full, with only a couple of seats going to spare. The woman who seated us seemed curt and sullen, however, there was a man who served our table for the most part (the woman refilled our tea once). The man was friendly, smiling and helpful.

We went for AYCE. And it was fine. I didn't get food poisoning, which always raises my rating of a restaurant where raw fish is served by one star.*

So it was fine. And the rolls were... fine. The ones made for us last night didn't look like they were made by a ""blindfolded 8 year old cutting with a hacksaw"" (as another reviewer eloquently put it--perhaps a different sushi chef, or else she encountered she same sushi chef as we did, but at the beginning of his career, and how he's in that mid-career slump). On the other hand, perhaps that would have made them more interesting, at least visually? They were pretty standard AYCE, generally. Taste-wise, they were fine, but not fabulous. Each piece of my dynamite roll was too big to manage in one bite, and we all know that this makes for some messiness, as you have to do it in two bites, the flavours don't blend the same way, and unless you're that special combination of skilled and lucky, it falls apart while your'e chewing your first bite. But it was fine. Nothing to write home about (home being Vancouver, where sushi is generally yum and less uneven than the stuff out here, it seems).

One special note is the spicy salmon roll. Last summer at a sushi place on the Danforth whose name I do not recall, a friend warned us away from the spicy rolls. He said that they use crappy cuts of fish and disguise it with the spicy sauce. I had never heard of such a thing--we often have sushi out in Waterloo (as we live there part time), and it has always been fine--the same cut of fish as the regular roll, with some spicy sauce drizzled over.

Last night, I saw what my friend meant. The spicy salmon roll featured finely chopped salmon, mixed with the spicy sauce--and closer examination confirmed that yes, the lighter stuff in the chopped meat side was not merely sauce, but also fatty, less appealing bits. I tried a bite and this reinforced my friend's warning, which I now pass on to you, with the note that at least for now, in Waterloo, this is not the case. There, the spicy rolls are not crappy cuts of meat disguised by spice. But sadly, at least some AYCE places here, no doubt faced with higher overhead and fierce competition, seem to have decided to take short cuts where they can least afford to--on the food itself, while hoping that the flat rate AYCE pricing will make up for it. The fact that I won't rush back to this place indicates that at least for me, the pricing doesn't make up for it--I'd rather have a tasty bento box, well-prepared, than such mediocre AYCE. 

*I think my rating would more accurately (from the descriptions) be ""meh--I've had better"" because this is precisely true. But, most people seem to be writing really horrid reviews alongside their two star ratings, so I assume that 2 stars is actually more negative than that and three stars is more of a ""meh"" in practice. I'm going with that.",4,3,-HlfeTND7PATNVduJ_35lA,review,0

Starting with udon noodles that was the size of a full entree(oversized) after a minor complaint to the owner who barely acknowledged our annoyance the rest of the food came.. Which was just as ridiculously large followed by more of a sour attitude. My boyfriend and I head to pay the bill and left promptly to take photos of the resto to review later.

The servers seemed tired, but service was still good. We were promptly served our tea and water when we sat down, and the two waitressess tag-teamed our table returning multiple times through the meal to top up both types of drinks.

We came for the All You Can Eat (AYCE) dinner on a moderately busy Saturday night - there may have been 4 or 5 other tables being served along with us. On the weekends, the price is apparently raised by $1, so instead of it being $15.99 now, it's $16.99 on a Saturday (and I can only assume that applied to Friday and Sunday as well). (note: they did have the ""lower"" menu for $12.99 weekend price, but my buddy said that one doesn't come with Sashimi, so we went with the higher priced one.

The sushi was good. It wasn't great (I lived in Vancouver and have had GREAT sushi back in the day) but in my opinion it wasn't gross as some have suggested by any means. The presentation on our plates was also nice, as our multiple rolls and sashimi came out nicely presented (and our white salmon sashimi - which comes in thin strips - was presented looking like the flower of a rose, a beautifully artistic interpretation that I hadn't seen before.)

Sashimi was quite good. Nice and fresh. No complaints. Sushi rolls do come with a lot of rice, but they were tasty too. They had a few rolls I'd never seen before like the ""Excellent Role"" (I know, how awesome of a name is that!) which was shrimp and banana. My girlfriend and I felt adventurous and tried it and it worked really well in our opinion.

On the AYCE menu there was only 1 dessert, tempura friend Banana, which they pour a little chocolate over, and it was actually quite tasty. When we finished, they also offered us complimentary ice cream (Green Tea or Coconut flavours).

Overall, this place wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I've had better sushi, but I was spoiled living a few years on the west coast. The AYCE menu is pretty thorough with lots of choice, and the price is decent. I've not had much Sushi yet in Toronto since moving here, but this place was pretty good for what you got.

I would actually consider it a rice ball more than sushi. We had ayce but all we ended up getting were the rolls first and by the time we got through the rolls we had no more space for the sashimi. Bottom line, they tried to fill us up with rice so that we would eat less of the sashimi or other food on the menu (cheaper for them).

My boyfriend wanted to celebrate a win by taking me to AYCE and we decided to finally cross off Mariko on our AYCE hit-list. For $16.99 all-you-can-eat, we didn't have any high expectations of the food quality. We just wanted to be full and be merry.

Food was average-below average but enough to satisfy. Tempura was never crispy (and if you think that's an undercooked yam tempura, no, it's just carrot.) The salmon sashimi was probably the only highlight of our night, though they were poorly deboned.

But oh, did we wait... I think we came in at 9:30PM and our first order didn't come in until 10:20ish. There were only three other tables. It was like this with all our orders until closing time. I guess on the bright side, we finally paced ourselves at AYCE and there were a set of flies that entertained us as we tried to keep them off of our chopsticks.

Service though? Really bad. Like, I don't think I've ever been this baffled by service in my life especially since my entire family (also Chinese) works in the restaurant scene. To start off, we were handed two sheets for AYCE but no pen/pencil. No plates for anything until we asked for them during our second order. Water has no ice and was lukewarm. I would not be surprised if it was like those restaurant stories my parents tell of places that rinse utensils in drinking water. Ha..

Communicating with the staff is terrible. They're always in a rush (to not serve the other customers) and were really condescending. I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt especially if English is not they're first language when it comes to tone (since I understand this issue having interacted with so many ESL Chinese) but no... the staff is just plain grumpy 24/7. 

We were charged an extra ~$4 due to some miscommunication and after waiting for our waitress's 20 minute phone call to end, we flagged her down. We disputed this charge but instead of rectifying this issue (sounds familiar to some other yelp reviews?!) they asked why we even bothered coming here instead of the other AYCEs on Bloor. W-what? We were willing to pay the extra charge since it was a misunderstanding on both ends and it was only $4 but the immediate lashing out that occurred from wanting to get the situation clarified was downright unnecessary. They eventually removed the charge and we even *tipped* them (something I will regret to this day.) I was even more put off by how fiercely the waitress grabbed the money off of the table sans the tray by slamming her palm down on the bills and then clenching them in a fist while I was in the middle of exiting the booth..

There are two options for AYCE. So, for people who only like Veg, Chicken, or Beef in their rolls and no fish you don't have to pay full pop.

The decor is in keeping with the nicer sushi restaurants in the area.

The Bad:

Way too much rice on the sushi. I know there is supposed to be rice on sushi, I'm not freaking out over carbs. This was out of hand. There was hardly any fish in the rolls! Where are the nice big chunks of salmon and tuna? 

The rolls were not well assembled. some where falling apart when picked up with chop sticks - the sign of a poorly trained (if at all) sushi chef. 

We like to order a lot of sashimi. The first round of salmon sashimi was excellent. The second round was clearly cut the tail end of the fish were there is more marbling and fat. This cut of salmon is not normally for sushi. It's creamier consistency is better for some rolls, but not sashimi. 

The severs were nice, but very difficult to communicate with. This is pretty typical for a lot of sushi restaurants in the area. 

The Ugly:

When you're given a menu and pen/pencil to fill it out, a 4cm pencil covered in black gunk is not what you want when you're ordering food. 

It took forever for our first order to arrive! I'm not expecting fast food, but at least bring out the first roll or two within 15 minutes.

I know I say this about pretty much every Japanese restaurant except Japango, Asahi and Yuzu no Hana, but this has to be the worst one in Toronto.

OBVIOUSLY it is run by Chinese folk, not Japanese, which makes it all the more obvious why it sucks. I asked for a substitution and they said: NO CAN DO, until I offered to pay more money to avoid eating crap. *rolls eyes*

The miso soup was standard but I only got 2 tofu cubes.

I also got the chicken teriyaki which was not what I was expecting, it came as a sizzling hot plate instead of drenched in that thick lovely soy sauce and flavoured beautifully. It lacked seasoning, was on a bed of horribly cooked onions and carrots, and I was so hungry, I ate it all.

Are we alone in the universe? How is Mariko still in business? We may never find out the answer to that last one, but let's try to wrap our heads around it for the time being. 

Sure, it may be relatively cheap for an AYCE, but starving to death is also cheap. At least with the latter you can die a dignified death and not have your hippocampus tarnished with the memory of ever coming to this place. With poor service, a menu with text printed in the smallest size font in faded red (ask the staff for a magnifying glass if you don't have your electron microscope handy), low quality fish, and a whopping 7 conditional passes from Dinesafe(!) under its belt, it truly is a wonder how this place is still around. Considering the rising presence of Japanese food in the area, such an environment should've put this place out of its misery ages ago.

My first visit to this location was initiated by their signage.  They always seem to have some sort of special on, which is great for students.  They have a $10.99 AYCE menu (albeit VERY limited), and a $14.99 AYCE which includes sashimi (2 or 3 types).  They also have ""FREE DAYS"", where each day of the week, you get something free with your meal (ie. tofu & miso on Sundays).

Both times I have been there, service has been brutal.  There were times that the waitress was just sitting at a table with her head down, and one of the chefs would come over to serve us after our failed attempts to get her attention.

The first visit, I ordered   la carte, and the food came out beautifully prepared and displayed.  (see picture I will be uploading)
The second visit, which was AYCE, it was as though they couldn't care less.  It was all just laid on a big plate in rows.  The salmon sashimi came out in super thin slices, yet all still stuck together by some fatty tissue at the corner.  I have never seen sashimi cut so poorly in my life!  And the fish just did not seem like sushi grade.  I was so disgusted, I didn't re-order anything but basic rolls.  But even the spicy salmon roll was purely mushy, and it appeared that the chef hadn't cleaned his prep area between preparing rolls.  Rolls that weren't supposed to have fish eggs on them had a few scattered bits of tobiko around the outside, that clearly didn't come from just being on the plate.  It's so important for sushi chefs to use clean surfaces when preparing different rolls or fish.   For a second time, I was disgusted.

The interior is a cold blue, and the lighting is just as unwelcoming.  I think they've installed fluorescent lighting panels on the walls, and put transparent images of bamboo over them, as if they could act as sconces.  FAIL

We overheard a diner behind us asking the waitress to recommend something delicious he hadn't tried before, and she suggested the dynamite roll.  I couldn't believe it.  The customer looked pretty disappointed too.  If I had to rank the million sushi places on Bloor, Mariko would be wayyy down on my list.  If you're going to try it, my only advice is not to go for the AYCE.  It's just not worth it in the end if you can't enjoy your meal.  Part of the joy of sushi is the presentation and preparation.  It should be a feast for the eyes as well, and Mariko seems to think that it's alright to offer an inferior meal to their AYCE customers.

The lasagna looked very portion packed and when we asked about it, the waiter said ""its frozen, we just heat is up"" you would assume for 20 bucks at least could  make their own lasagna. What's the point going to a restaurant to have something heated up when you can do the same thing at home?

1. the waitresses were not very attentive at all even though we were THE ONLY table.

2.

3. Fine... so off we go to the hot buffet (the selection was very LIMITED) but we thought how can we go wrong with $6 buffet? WRONG! The scramble eggs was blah and the bacons tasted like it'd been several days old...

7tY4Cksdo9wRN4EkVqHH5Q,JxBs6zbB4CsBNKRi_gPt2Q,2009-03-31,3,"Toronto dim sum is the standard by which all others are judged, not having had any significant amount of dim sum in China.  Even a dim sum restaurant owner in San Francisco agreed with me.  This is my favourite cheap dim sum spot in Toronto, and I've ne ver had a bad meal.  There are other places that are fancier or with a bit more variety, but you will pay significantly more.  Your choice!

I've been going here since it was called Imperial Gourmet Garden.  Then one day they closed up shop, changed the name on the door, and reopened with this new name.  All the same people out front, and presumably in the kitchen.  The dim sum has always been tasty, and quite the bargain during the week.  Pay a little attention to the cart-pushing-waiters...you might just learn a little Cantonese!

The beef ribs are excellent, and quite hard to find many places.  Also, malai go is super tasty...it's like steamed sponge cake.  Try it!  You won't be disappointed.  On a Sunday, get there before the crowds swarm the place at 11:30-ish.",1,4,6KJJN6dm5T85foIo_pVKBg,review,2

This Chinese dumpling is served as part of the countless dim sum carts at Yiu Wah Restaurant. Dim sum, meaning ""from the heart"", is an anytime food but best had from 11:30am to 1pm - that's when the carts are at high volume sending around your favourite dishes (which go for $2-3 for a small dish but when you get a whole bunch for a full table of hungry people, your very satisfying lunch will only cost you 8-10 happy dollars). The only thing is you might not see the same food carted around in every visit. They have their usual but when they'll show up is always a fun mystery.

There is an obvious language barrier here but so worth it. Don't be ashamed to just point and nod at food here. It's socially acceptable.

Among my favourites:
* the aforementioned shaomai (w/ pork)
* sweet & sour pork
* steamed bean curd rolls
* pork bun

A surprise hit with me:
* crab balls

A MUST HAVE!:
* garlic green beans (the BEST I've ever had ANYWHERE! But order this from the waiter once you sit down because this does not get carted around with the rest of them).

My salad and my girlfriend's soup were both good so we got off to a good start food wise. My steak was good, though I was disappointed there weren't any dinner rolls. The baked beans I got looked a little pureed but they were very good. I wanted a baked potato but they didn't have any. I got mashed potatoes instead but didn't like them because they were chunky (kind of like potato salad).

My girlfriend said her steak salad was good, but the breadstick it came with was undercooked to the point it was cold in the middle. The chocolate cake we had for dessert was very good.

The service itself was pretty weak. That would have been understandable if it was very busy but there were only a few other people there so that was disappointing.

The Chinese Chicken Salad is excellent, and as a veggie option you can substitute the chicken with shredded cheese (which is also very good!) The salads are huge for the price, and be warned, a large can easily feed 2-3 people, while a small is the perfect size for 1.

Now I have to say, the service is not the best, but the place is small so it's easy to flag someone over if you need to. The food does come quickly, but expect the server to disappear after you've been brought your food, and possibly not visit for the duration of the meal.

They might have two locations.  The one we visited was on 410 Place Jaques.  We were in the Old Montreal part of town on Saturday June 8 looking for a spot to eat.  It was the Grand Prix week-end so naturally a lot of places were full.  It was fairly chilly outside and drizzling and we had been walking for close to two hours looking at various places and menus.  

Finally we came upon this place and it looked very quaint, with a full patio and outside heaters.  The maitre'd greeted us and informed us that their specialty was seafood, all fresh.  I love seafood so we were sold.  Went to sit inside since we were cold and wet, but as soon as went it, we started questioning our decision.  The place was dated, and not nearly as busy as the patio.  There was also a foul fryer mixed with rotting fish smell so we decided to move outside.

we ordered the calamary which was chewy, yellow and tasted old, and the snails which there were only 4 of and no bigger than the ones you get at the keg.  They were covered in cheese and mushrooms (of which there was no mention of on the menu but i happen to like mushrooms so i did not complain).

On to mains.  Since they touted that they were known for their seafood i ordered the muscles and my partner ordered the fillet mignon.  Both were awful.  the filet tasted as if had been in the fridge for over 3 weeks - tough with a weird spongy time of texture, and very bad flavour.  The muscles were not fresh and many did not open during the cooking process.  The broth - the little that existed - had no flavour other than overly salty.

very pricey, food quality sub par, service left much to be desired. I am surprised we did not get sick. I would not go back if you paid me.",0,1,8-UimW8awULAZWuKUq9nKg,review,0

Staying upstairs in the small yet lovely seven room Le Relais Lyonnaise (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hotel-le-relais-lyonnaise-montreal#hrid:tNEe9qqV1iexbFUbNqaS8g), the kind owner explained that he also operates this cafe, and that breakfast is included for guests in this public cafe.  (That was a nice bonus as when booking the room there was no mention of a free included breakfast.)  

My review is only for the breakfast as I didn't come for any other meals or for the attractive selection of desserts in the displayed fridge (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ?select=WVECS2J92y8C0xZqD2aA-g).

The breakfasts were quite hearty and ranged from omelets (I had a nice cheese and herb omelet one day) to crepes to bagel with lox.  

My favourite breakfast of the bunch turned out to be the bagel with lox.  They served a fresh bagel covered with a very generous amount of lox.  Cream cheese was served on the side, along with a side salad (typical mixed greens like from a market served with a nice dijon mustard based dressing) and some fresh fried potatoes (these were exceptionally tasty).  I've never had salad and potatoes with my breakfast bagel before, but it somehow worked and turned into my favourite breakfast offering at the cafe.  Here is a photo of it:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/28rRiCNsqRf95R6jj3ENcQ?select=8ldkGMWDtAFMo5NidT5EfA

So, we thought that experience could be continued at Brioche Lyonnaise.  We were mistaken.  The room temperature, floppy sponge crepes given to us were not fresh and had barely any fillings.  Nor were they served with a side of anything appetizing to try to make up for their mistakes.

I went to wash my hands and noticed how dark and dirty the corridors leading into the kitchen were. The bathroom stank!! Then I saw someone, who I later found out was the manager, walking from the storage area to the kitchen with my french toast in a see through plastic bag. I then saw him put it in a microwave in the grotty kitchen. $11. French toast. MICROWAVED?!

Stupidly, I gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and didn't say anything. My iced latte arrived. It had espresso, and cold milk, topped off with HOT FROTH and NO ICE. Seriously? Not only is that disgusting, it's also dangerous - hot and cold milk should never be mixed. When I worked at Starbucks this was the first thing we were taught - never accommodate any customer who wants hot foam on an iced espresso drink. It tasted horrible and the server seemed confused when I asked for a mug of ice to help make the drink actually, yknow, ICED.

The food arrived. The french toast was as gross as it looked in that plastic bag. It was soggy, flat and worst of all - STALE. the watermelons that came with it would have needed a steak knife to cut. My bf is NOT a fussy eater, but took one bite into his sorry looking croque madame (think microwaved ham and cheese on white bread) and said ''do you want to just leave?''. We were both that appalled. We eat out a lot, and have travelled a lot, eating in all sorts of restaurants, and this was the first time either of us ever left any restaurant anywhere because we were so disgusted with the food quality.

What was most interesting was that neither the servers nor the manager were particularly shocked when we said we were leaving and refused to pay. They didn't even protest, offer us anything else or defend themselves for charging $11 for microwaved french toast. After asking us for a bit of clarification, they simply said ''sorry, ok'' and shrugged their shoulders. I think that says a lot - I got the impression we were not the first customers to have done this recently.

-Crepe: I had the ratatouille with mushrooms, egg, and tomato paste. It is wrapped and presented in the most beautiful way. The taste was not so great, but this could have been a result of me eating it cold on my drive back down to NY so I will forgive and forget.

-Desserts: I cannot list all of the desserts I have tried here, because that would be an entirely long list. Just as delicious as they look, they ARE in fact, delicious. I am not a big fan of desserts that are too sweet, so I had to appreciate the lightness and subtlety of the fruit tarts. 

Perfect for bringing back gifts for family and friends.

Service is a hit or miss depending on the waitress. Bear in mind that they take orders, prepare the food, AND serve it. I initially wondered whether the mediocre service was because of cultural differences, but I just realize that it wasn't and that this place is just poppin' and busy as can be.

Super long wait at the non-crowded bar while I had the pleasure of watching the male bartender flirt with the female waitstaff for over 5 minutes. No acknowledgement or apologies from the staff for severely sub-par service. 

Detailed review: The service is just plain awful. I've been a few times now before deciding to finalize my opinion and write a review, and after my last visit this past weekend I'm compelled to warn people to stay away if you're looking for a place with anything resembling even mediocre service. I stood at the bar (dead center, with no one standing in front of me) for over 5 minutes before the bartender even took my order. It was not busy, and there is no excuse for the wait - I had to watch the male bartender flirt and laugh with the female waitstaff the entire time. He never made eye contact or even bothered to acknowledge my presence the entire time I waited. When he finally came over, it was after he took the order and brought beers for the guy who stood next to me, and had only just recently ponied up to the bar about a minute previously. When I finally got my drink order (a very simple whisky cocktail and a draught PBR) the cocktail ended up being one of the worst I've ever had in my life. I don't understand how someone could mess up a simple cocktail so badly - I even asked a few friends to try it to make sure I wasn't overreacting. Their disgusted looks after they each took a sip proved me right. My experiences at this place in the past were warning enough, but after this last visit I will never go back.",0,1,DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA,review,0

Went here for a free show--a touring band from Norway. The band was good, sound was good, vibe was good--until I walked up to the bar. I appeared to be interrupting something when I walked up. I then asked the female bartender how much the well drinks were and she said $5 as if she was already annoyed with me. I then asked her what a buckshot was (since that was the $1 special on the board.) She didn't have a straight answer and instead asked the male bartender, ""it's uh whatever we feel like making, we'll start with whiskey?"" 

I ordered it, what the hell, YOLO. Big mistake--the ""buckshot"" tasted like cough medicine and corn syrup. 

Before my order was complete the male and female bartender are snickering with each other as if they are sharing their own private joke. I seriously felt like I was transported back to middle school--who does that? I got the feeling that these two weren't happy with the crowd nor the band--but that shouldn't really matter. The crowd was there drinking (and tipping) these two because of the band. Why the attitude? 

Before the band's set was over the male bartender starts cleaning up the venue, pushing chairs in (loudly) and collecting glasses from tables. The lead singer says into the microphone ""are we being kicked out?"" to which she gets no response. The male bartender and female bartender appeared to be flirting with one another in the back corner, laughing at customers, etc. I definitely wasn't the only one that was feeling uncomfortable. These two bartenders were not only chasing the crowd away but also the headlining band. 

The venue itself had a cool vibe (aside from the nu-metal blaring in between sets), the prices were slightly more than average ($5 for a draft beer, $5 for a well drink, $1 for a ""buckshot"") and the service, well the service was non-existence. I felt like the duo was put out by my presence. Word of advice if you are the duo reading this--if your income is highly dependent upon tips, you should probably be nicer to the 20 or so people that are actually in your bar on a Monday night instead of driving them (and the band they came to see) away.",0,2,DAMQ2VtdwZsVed8BC3Z9rA,review,0

Short Review: We were completely ignored, waited forever to get our food order taken and I had to take up my soda to the bar to get a refill.

Long Review: We were planning on going out to eat before getting to The Western, but after hitting traffic we thought we'd play it safe and just eat at the venue. We had never been, so when we arrived at 7:00 we thought the doors would be open to serve food, but when they say doors open and 7:30, they open at 7:30. As we were waiting outside, 7:30 rolled around and we were told the doors would be opening at 7:45 instead. Okay, fine, we were hungry but we could wait. 7:45, doors didn't open. 8:00, doors didn't open. Finally around 8:15, 15 minutes after the show was suppose to start we got in and we grabbed one of the first tables we saw, right at the front near the stage. 

We sat down and were handed menus pretty quickly. A waitress came around and asked if we'd been helped, we said no and ordered a Coke (which was 90% ice) and PBR. We then mentioned that we'd be ordering food tonight. Then about a minute later another waitress came over and asked if we'd been helped, we said yes and assumed they a communication or organizational issue. About 5 minutes later a bartender brought over our drinks and we started noticing food being brought out to the booths behind us. We overheard the people behind us get asked if they wanted food to eat twice, yet our waitress walked right by us. We tried several times to flag someone down, but the opening band had already begun to play so it was difficult to get anyone's attention. 

After being ready for 15 minutes, and watching everyone else get their food orders, our waitress came back and we finally got our order in. I don't remember the specifics but we got the grilled cheese and a burger. We got our food about 5 minutes later, which was okay, nothing special. At that point we were so hungry would have been happy if they just brought us over some Taco Bell. About halfway through the meal, we both ran out of drinks, down to the last drop of watered down Coke. We began another round of find your waitress as our food got cold. And once again she walked past a few times. After about 5 minutes of trying I just gave up and walked over to the end of the bar with my empty glass. Our waitress walked over to the bar and since the bartender was busy I asked her for another Coke and PBR. She replied with a cheery, ""Sure! I'll bring that right over!"" I guess she didn't find it strange that I was trying to get my own refill. She brought over our drinks and we finished our meal. Then the fastest service we got was her bringing us the bill.

I guess they were closing the books or whatever - so I got in free. SCORE! So I headed to the stage area to watch the band and boy what a cluster. Place was already packed to the gills with folks and there wasn't a whole lot of room to expand outward since there are mostly tables once you pass the main floorspace. Sound was decent - it was just a duo with no drumkit so that would have been hard to mess up. Can't complain because I didn't pay a cent for the whole experience and didn't even bother to get a drink. Managed to skip the openers and see just what I wanted. Not a bad venue but it probably works best for local acts with a smaller audience given the small space.

For not paying a cover, the band here was fantastic. They had people on the dance floor all night. The dance floor is a pretty good size for people to have fun and move. The drinks were delicious and very reasonably priced. I noticed a small little section of the restaurant right off the dance floor that looked like it was reserved for a private party. I would highly recommend checking it out if you have a birthday or bachelorette or something coming up in the future. It seemed pretty private but right off the stage and dance floor so you're still part of all the action. The service was also pretty fast and on top of things.

I typically do not eat BBQ, but sweet mother mary of jesus....YES, YES, YES!  

Why is this place so awesome?

1. I actually met the grill master THAT GRILLED MY FOOD!  I met the man behind the delicious-ness that was my meal; he is amazing.
2. The staff/bartenders are cool.as.shit.  Seriously, they work in old town Scottsdale AND they are nice / pleasant / outgoing / cordial / amazing.  Do you know how hard that is to find in Old Town Scottsdale? 
3. They were really nice to my mom.... That gets kudos in my book.
4. All of the food was super fantastic - from the salmon to the all-your-fat-ass-can-eat-Sunday-special (which I got); it was all ahhh-mazing!  My mom literally ate her entire salmon fillet, rice pilaf, corn husk, and licked the plate so hard I think she bore a hole in it.  I ate the pork butt sliders + coleslaw + ribs + chicken + yes = happy Siobhan. 
5. I randomly found this place through Groupon and I am very pleasantly surprised.  :) 
6. They have a sweet happy hour from 5pm to 7pm....half off appetizers + cheap drinks.... Will you marry me Mr. Western?

In conclusion, this is a newer place with live music, awesome food, and even better staff.  So.... Sweet mother mary of jesus, YES, YES, YES!

In short, he was very disorganized and at least 3 people who were waiting on him to take new orders, left. He spend almost 10min working on my food, he didn't bother to take new orders. He was the only person running the truck. 

The fries were bad as expected and the grilled cheese tasted funky. He didn't used american sliced cheese, but used shredded cheese. He also used 2 regular size breads you get at Fry's. For these two orders, I paid $12.50. 

In addition, his idea of curry meal on the whiteboard showed a large plate nicely prepared with the toppings. I saw a guy ordering it and he got a small Styrofoam bowl with some premade curry served in it. That cost him $6.

Also, grilled vegetables are not a proper vegetarian choice in 2015, especially in a restaurant that features beans and cheese in so many other dishes.
- The booze situation. Every table outdoors is adorned with a centerpiece of three beers (not included, just to be clear). The first two pages of the food menu are actually a drink menu. When we were ready to order, with closed menus, our waitress reopened my menu to the drink pages and went on at great length about what was available.

When you can't find authentic Turkish food it's like you have no choice but to go here hoping that you'll get lucky and eat something  decent, but unfortunately you can't eat anything good here . First they don't know how to make doner , bulgur pilav is sooooo dry have absolutely no taste ,let's talk about so called Adana kebab now that's a total joke it's just a minced meat filled with cheap quality red pepper to make it spicy and hoping that it becomes what is supposed to be but unfortunately it does not work that way , Now is the restaurant busy ? Ya kind of but with what kind of customers? Definitely majority of there customers don't have Turkish or let's say Armenian backgrounds , they cater to low budget middle eastern immigrants most of them from 3rd world country's where they don't have any idea what Turkish food is . 
People who reads our reviews will see that so far we don't have 1 good review about Turkish restaurants in Ontario and Quebec , that's because we travel to Istanbul 4 to 6 times a year and we really know what Turkish kebab is  unfortunately there is not one decent Turkish kebab restaurant specially in Quebec .
Place looks like a old Middleastern mosque with all green walls , and the music that you hear while you eat? Omg in Turkish we say (AGIT) meaning? Sad crying song when someone dies this is the kind of music they listen at uncivilized Turkish villages. Before I forget Shepard salad , ezme are sitting on the counter( not in the fridge) yes on the counter covered with Saran Wrap so it does not get dirty , you have to eat warm Shepard salad that's unfortunate :))))) 
Is the place clean yes it is but then again that does not make the food good, 
Iam hoping 1 day In Montreal we will have a good Turkish kebab restaurants like Toronto or New York but I have no hopes ,why I don't have hopes?  Because who wants to invest in Montreal ? They rather go to Toronto Vancouver etc where they don't have to put up with tax or French bs.

LzSa9K9JD3JxlToygKvIYQ,faaOI6hU64h6SSaF0f11eg,2009-01-14,5,"I remember Country Kitchen when I was a young boy living in Minnesota.  The restaurants were a lot fewer back then so going out to eat was a big deal.  My memories of it when being a child were all of people that I was with, and not the food, and now I think I know why...  If the food was as bland back then as it is now, it is completely forget-able.  

I have dined at this Country Kitchen on several occaisions after movies at the UltraStar Theater (they should drop the Ultra...)  and I have brought my family here several times for breakfast or quick lunches etc.  It will do in a pinch, but I have yet to be really wowed and I am pretty sure I will not be.

Country Kitchen is a lateral move from Dennys and IHOP, with a slightly better focus on service however given the area I know that service will be the first thing to go.  The area of the restaurant and indeed the area where I live is plagued by the economy.  We are a neighborhood of the haves and the have-nots.  When the have-nots barely speak english and disrepect the community it shows and it takes it's toll on the service people.  But I digress...back to the Country Kitchen.

It is a bit pricey for what you get but there are lots of coupons out there including some from their own web site.  So if you must eat here, bring a coupon or the bill will somewhat infuriate you due to the wholly unexceptional food.  Without a coupon expect to pay 15-20% more than a Dennys or Village Inn for about the same food.

On the bright side, I have had lunch here several times and really enjoyed the Reuben, so there is at least one sandwich that has some flavor and was not a dissapointment.  So there we have it, if you are dragged here to eat, get a Reuben.  : )

Enjoy!",1,2,-aaVZUYi4Ys_DP0rcBsFTg,review,2

the other night we got back from happy hour and appetizers with some coworkers of mine and we were still hungry, not feeling like fast food we call up country kitchen and order an order of their sliders and 2 milkshakes. they don't give us an eta or a total on the phone.

so I wait about 10-15 minutes, leave my house which is about 2 mi away, arrive at the restaurant to find it completely barren at about 7:30PM, I approach the counter and the manager just continues to mess with his blackberry never looking up eventually, a hostess comes from the back and greets me, mind you it's already been 15 minutes and all they need to do was grill some small beef pattys and drop some fries, I still end up waiting another 10 minutes for my food, only to have everyone disappear into the back of the restaurant again to have another server come out confused and try to seat me. eventually I get the food, the sliders aren't bad, but there's only 3, WTF it's an unwritten rule that sliders come in even numbers, I don't know if it's just me, or working in a White Castle as a teen, but 3 sliders could potentially cause a rift in some relationships, 

the decor is an orgy of applebees, IHOP and denny's but imagine if you arrived  at the ""campy wall crap"" store only to find they'd already been cleaned out by an applebees corporate decorator, the decorations range from giant utensils, wireframe art, sports posters and scenic views.  I'm really not sure which direction they were trying to go.

The food was pretty marginal overall.  It was definitely NOT hot enough.  Replicator food on the Enterprise is better than this.  Want to piss me off?  Serve me tepid food and then charge me $8 cubits a head for same.  Some items were better than others.  I almost think there were too many choices.

Their festive signage caught me on the way to another venue for lunch, and I thought ""why not Chinese?""  I'll tell you why; or at least, why not to select this buffet.

Being greeted on the way in with a ""You are on camera"" sign sure is welcoming.  I was quickly greeted, though, and directed to my seat.  My drink order was taken before I even sat down, which was nice.  Too many buffets have you walk in, sit down, select a beverage, stand up, and proceed to self-service, and it was nice to save a couple of steps.

But then I got to the food.  Nearly everything had the congealed look of having been out too long; the skin on the surface of the sweet-and-sour sauce was rubbery and at least a half-centimeter thick.  Not exactly appetizing.  I did, however, find some acceptable-looking specimens and returned to my table.

The warmest of the foods could only generously be called lukewarm; most of the chicken was marbled with glibbery wads of fat, and all the sauces tasted sugary and generic.  I could literally not tell the ""orange chicken"" from the ""sesame chicken"" from the ""pepper chicken"" by any sense other than sight.

The rice was room-temperature, but I barely know this because as I was forking a mouthful of rice together on the plate, the alternately obsequious and intrusive waitstaff tried to take my plate out from under me (though, in retrospect, they may have been trying to save me).

The fruit selection, which I also sampled, looked fine, but was in fact soggy and also room-temperature to lukewarm.

They have a somewhat vast dessert selection -- particularly for a buffet -- but I'd more than had my fill.

Walking toward the register, there was a prominent sign re-advising me that walk-outs are recorded and will be reported to the police and prosecuted.  There were three more similar signs at the register/gift shop (!).  Again, very welcoming.

The open air area was a complete hot box, very humid to the point that people were sticking to the booths. Hostess then left, didn't leave menus, beer lists, nothing! Server arrived and could tell we were annoyed, we informed her that it was our first time there, we were just rushed in, and wanted to switch to the other side. She told us to, ""Just go tell the hostess"". We did, she again just rushed us over to the booth as if there was something wrong with sitting at the bar itself. We then sat in a different booth for a full 15 minutes without a single employee coming over to us! I have NEVER walked out of a restaurant until that moment.

I was a member of their Mug Club from the moment they started it, and I miss it horribly. So naturally I was very disappointed that the brewing equipment is gone. Don't let the name fool you, Brewstone Beerhouse is not a brew pub. However they do have a fairly good list of craft beer available, as well as the regular cra*.  The service was very good. Our waiter, Lindley (?) was very nice and attentive, extremely helpful as was the bartender in the back bar. The food was good, I had a burger (cooked perfectly, very tasty) It was a little loud, there was a live musician playing by the patio area, but in the back by the restrooms the place was much quieter.

Booths each had their own individual TVs (along with several TVs on the walls) but there are also fireplaces and other items that didn't seem to go with the individual TVs.

The menu is equally as mixed.  There are traditional bar favorites, but then there were some ""fancy"" things as well.

The nacho appetizer is HUGE.  The two of us could have eaten it and not had an entree and still been full.  It was tasty, but they should consider cutting the portion and the price.  Or at least having a half order option.

The corn chowder is amazing.  I loved the taste and texture and was disappointed when it was gone.

Restaurant: L shaped setup. Two bars full bars, one indoor and one indoor/outdoor. The indoor bar is in between the main entrance and the dining room. The indoor/outdoor is to the left of the entrance away from the rest of the restaurant. The indoor/outdoor bar has booths with personal TV's, an ""O"" shaped bar with plenty of big screen TV's, and roll up doors which are open on nice nights leading to the outdoor patio. The place is very nice and clean. Very nice look and upkeep

Drink: Great beer selection. They have a long list of beer on tap which includes your normal domestics, seasonal beers, and micro brews. Most places do not have this selection which is amazing for people who enjoy this type of selection. PLUS, they have a two full bars for people who love liquor. 

Food: Food has changed since the name has changed and the business is under new management. The menu is similar but not quiet the same and they have rid the menu of many of the items that I liked. They have a good variety consisting of steak, chicken, sea food, burgers, and homemade pizzas. Overall the food is decent but not as good as it used to be. 

Atmosphere: Great overall. Dining room and inside bar are a good casual family area. The Indoor/Outdoor bar is separate and has more of a casual bar feel to it. Great place for any occasion and for sports games. 

Staff: Overall they are not bad but they are certainly not great either. Some of the waiters/waitresses are good and some not so much. All of them are friendly however some seem very new while others are veterans in the food service. The service is very inconsistent. More consistency would go a long way. 

Overall: Good but not great. I miss the Indoor/Outdoor bar being open more often. It really gave the place a different dimension and a more causal relaxing feel that nowhere else really offers during nice days. I also miss the homemade dressings, specialty pizzas, BBQ sauce, and custom burgers. Sure they offer these things but they are not the same as before. I like the place and will go there occasionally but not as much as before.

The manager (Carrie) came over and apologized to us for the quality of the food, and for the wait time, and assured us she would take care of it.    Within 10 minutes, we had a replacement of our wings and burger, and this time they were cooked perfectly.

We stopped in last night for dinner and were very impressed.  As mentioned in another review, the place is spotless. They invested some serious cash in converting the decor from what used to be a dimly lit John Harvards location.   Two bars seems odd however but both were relatively busy. 

I went with the fish and chips as it's my baseline for what any bar/pub should get right without worry. It was a bit light on fish and heavy on fries but both were good, so I can't really complain for the price. Better half had the BBQ pork sliders (carolina style) and thoroughly enjoyed them. 
Mixed drink for her and draft micro for me seemed reasonably priced. 
Draft beer list was certainly bigger than I expected from earlier reviews. 

Having a TV inside every booth seemed excessive, but should go over extremely well with the sports crowd and should do wonders for BW3's prices and awful service across the street.  At least none of them had volume on. 
Wait staff seemed very attentive but this may also be because they just opened and over-compensate. 

A roof over the patio seems necessary, we'll never sit outside on a sunny day without it and nobody was out there either on our visit.

The decor... 4.5 stars.  Lots of seating options indoors and out.  Tons of TV's available for game day viewing.

The menu... 3 stars.  It's got the usual sports bar fare, but because the place looks so nice, I expected a more extensive menu that just a one page, black and white printed list of their offering.  Perhaps we got a game-time/lunch menu??

The food... 4 stars.  Among the 6 of us, we ordered 2 kids of wings (Garlic Parm & the Whiskey Bourbon), but for $10 you'd think you get more than 8 wings per serving.  Both flavors tasted pretty good; though I would have liked a little more garlic or salt on the garlic parm flavor.  We also got the nachos - pretty standard, and a variety of burgers.  Everyone enjoyed the burgers.  Very flavorful and moist.  The drinks from the bar were pretty sweet.

The service... 1 star.  Sure, it was game-time, opening weekend of the NFL season, but the place wasn't packed.  Most of the patrons were seated in either of the two bar areas.  I only saw one table in the large dining room.  So, either the placed wasn't properly staffed by management for a game-time crowd, or the service was incredible slow.  Our server was very nice and courteous even when I'm sure she could tell we were getting annoyed with repeating requests for refills on drinks long empty, or asking about the status of our food, but she kept a smile and responded politely.  

The pricepoint ... 3 stars.  The prices were about what you'd expect for bar food.  $10 for a burger, etc.

In all, while the food was pretty good and the set-up/layout of the place is nice, I think the only way I'd return is if I was truly there just to watch the game, and the drinks/snacks were an afterthought.  If I was going to hangout with friends and watch the game and wasn't going because I was hungry, then it might have been okay.",0,2,0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ,review,0
sQL_M2D95MOsYhigKwNp6A,MnTF124Hq3tE6zMeReceyg,2012-12-20,0,"Food Hounds... every so often while on the road, we come across a place that is so incredible that it raises our standards in coolness and flavor.  Brewstone Beer Company was one of those dynamite experiences that just put smiles on our faces.  An extremely large location with about four main dining areas and multiple bars, Brewstone not only serves up their own blends of house-brewed ale; but offers an array of mind-blowing food!  Right off the bat I was thrilled when they nailed my signature drink, The Brimstone Red - sweet and perfect!  Then they brought out this inconceivable platter of their Brewstone Signature Nachos that was utterly astonishing... never before have I been this floored with the MASSIVE size and flavor behavior of... well - Nachos.  Big enough for a hungry couple or a group, it was off the chain with tri-colored tortilla chips, fresh avocado, jack and cheddar cheese, house chili... should I go on?  We opted for all three meats: grilled chicken, steak and BBQ pulled pork to top our serving.  It came out piled-high with large chunks of chicken that had intense flavor and was moist, juicy and delish.  LOVED the sweet and tangy, smoky BBQ pork that was off the charts - total fan.  As for the steak... sweet and unbelievable!  Best nachos EVER in Food Hound history to date.

The Seared Ahi Tuna again blew my mind... Sashimi grade Ahi Tuna coated with black and white sesame seeds; the presentation was enticing - thick and meaty slices, cool and refreshing, fresh and fantasmic!  I thoroughly enjoyed their wasabi mousse - sweet and spicy with flavor that just makes you want more - WIN!  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were simple and divine; lettuce, chicken, wontons and carrots with a BOSS ginger soy sauce that enhances the taste of the whole shebang.  Something new that we've never experienced before was the Tri-Colored Cheese Sticks - the BIG difference is the use of cheddar as opposed to the typical mozzarella; but aside from the obvious... they utilize crushed tri-color tortilla chips in the batter used to coat the cheese before frying!  So fantastic and unique - they are paired with a spicy marinara and crispy onion straws for good measure.  Of course we had to try the Mac & Cheese - a hefty helping of over four cheeses co-mingling with penne, then topped with big chunks of luscious chicken to create a hot, steamy mini-meal (make sure every bite has some chicken).  The Corn Chowder had a chunky consistency of potatoes and corn with just a hint of seasoning with a bit of a kick to pop your taste buds.

The entrees cometh... we enjoyed a Tex-Mex Sandwich which was an overwhelming roller coaster of zesty flavor - juicy chicken offers an even keel on this sandwich; the pepper jack and jalapeno gives a spicy kick that is counteracted by the avocado adding a fresh cooling effect. The Shrimp Alfredo's flavor is ka-pow... big, juicy shrimp doused in an intense alfredo sauce - a hefty serving for a hungry critter!  Another big deal at Brewstone is their signature pizza - the Meatball Pizza was a solid and delicious pie; the meatballs were large, chunky and offered a great rendition of an old classic.  I almost passed out after the first bite of the Pulled Pork BBQ Pizza as it was orgasmic!  Sweet, smoky and explosive - stacked with fresh corn, their unreal pulled BBQ pork and delectable caramelized onions... full of cheese with a killer flavor.  Beautiful, bountiful... absurdly GREAT!  Lastly, the Chicken Madeira was like eating a Thanksgiving dinner; but with chicken- creamy mashed potatoes and saut ed green beans that were juicy, fresh and crunchy!  The chicken itself was tender and tucked into the plate with a thick blanket of mozzarella cheese and then drowned in heavenly gravy.  Everything was incredible from the food to the service and the environment itself; this is certainly not a place to be missed.  We'll be sure to pop in next time we're in town - especially for those nachos... Hmm... if I leave now...",0,4,0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ,review,1

Our server never mentioned anything special though we said we were new too the place. We asked what was great and she said, ""Well, pizza is really good, but our pizza chef isn't in yet. Everything else is decent."" (1pm on a Sunday). Not a good sign at all. We should have known by how empty the place was. 

So, I ordered a burger, medium, that had goat cheese and bacon (server told me not to get the goat cheese because it can be ""overpowering""--another bad sign since goat cheese is quite mild, but I asked for it anyways). Burger was overdone and not very juicy, and they left off the bacon and lettuce and tomatoes were smaller than the burger--not what you expect for a $11 burger.

Wife orders an ahi tuna salad vinaigrette on the side. Tuna was definitely cooked in the morning and refrigerated. It was dried out and scaly and they put the dressing on the salad anyways and put a second side of dressing. The dressing was unbelievably strong in vinegar flavor. So strong that my wife asked to take the tuna and have them just provide new greens. One fork dip in the dressing was strong enough. $16 worth of salad that was really something you expect to get at a luxury vending machine.

Beer was good, but she could have mentioned that they had a very limited draft list and that what I was ordering was a bottle. Food wasn't good. Service was, meh. In an empty restaurant, you expect servers to be accessible.

When our food arrived my burger was cooked well-done, flavorless & the sweet potato fries were room temperature at best. My husband stated that his pizza was sub-par at best and was clearly frozen pizza crust instead of freshly made. Throughout the course of visit random people (I'm assuming who were management but was hard to tell from their very causal jeans and tshirt) came by to take empty plates instead of asking about our food. Our waitress was scarce so we were often left with empty glasses.

This took her a few minutes and she informed us she would have to move a table. Which she did not need to do. She did not know the specials.

Then the waitress took our order, not when she originally talked to us but a few minutes later. She barely knew the specials. We ordered our drinks.

I asked about the food specials posted, and she said they did not have any. I asked a manager as well. The cards on the table said food specials. He said there were none. Then the waitress brought the check. Our beers were full price. She told me it was the beer tax. They were $4 per beer and had two different prices after this beer tax. She fixed it after this was pointed out to her. On the way out the manager did not even ask about the evening. He did not get my opinion and will not be getting my money again.

The Brewstone interior is beautiful, with lots of wood, and a gorgeous stone double-sided fireplace.

I really wanted to love Brewstone. We first tried it for dinner on Sept. 19. Service was slow to the point that the manager came out to apologize.

I am not writ ting this just to be critical; I am hoping the management will read this and make some much needed changes.

Since the place is a Sports bar, I am going to go with that ""format""...

Strike one:  Brewstone is not a brewpub, which is what I was expecting.  The ""beer experience"" is severely lacking as the ""beer menu"" was very confusing.  Instead of telling you what beer is what, the menu and the wait staff give you a vague, general idea of what beer you are going to get, such as a ""citrusy, hoppy beer,"" (which equates to an IPA) or a ""dark, sweet beer,"" (a stout).  Being a minor beer snob, I found the process bewildering as I had to guess at what I was going to get.  They should just tell you it's a ""Stone IPA,"" or ""Founder's Breakfast Stout,"" instead of letting you ""guess.""

Strike two:  The service was less than stellar.  Again, this may have improved, but after we ordered our drinks,  the waitress said she couldn't find the bartender, so there was a delay.  Our waitress (a very young woman) seemed to really be trying, but it seemed like she wasn't trained very well.  

Strike three:  The food, again wasn't great.  I got a burger and it was so-so.  My wife was mad that she didn't even get a piece of bread with her salad.  Our 2 friends weren't impressed either.  I spoke to someone else who ate there and they really liked the food, so maybe it was what we ordered..... dunno.

Overall, we were disappointed and underwhelmed.... and we really wanted to like the place.... there aren't too many places in Monroeville that I really like.  I hope the management reads these reviews and makes so much needed improvements.",0,2,0Wy4gw8krao9nGq-sHWFSQ,review,0

HbAmvrc3eSyzv-WlfVq9lQ,VESN6fIrmSe_VMqtn_z7nA,2012-07-27,0,"The place just opened last week, and I came on Wed night. The interior is enormous with two separate bar areas, a large dining room separated into two spaces by a dividing wall, and an outdoor patio space. The place is full of flat screen hdtv's, and will be a magnet for football fans on weekends in the fall. They have a major high-end sound system throughout the place (which was sadly playing 70's/80's pop music accompanied by videos on some of the tv's). The a/v investment is very impressive.

I have no doubt this place will be popular. The menu is full of reasonably priced classic sports bar fare like wings, nachos, pizza, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, etc. I stayed safe and went with bbq chicken wings for app and a cheeseburger for dinner. Both were good. Pints of craft beer were $3.50 on the night I came, but not sure if that was an opening week special or the normal price.

I have a couple of things to call out:
1) For a place called Brewstone, and with craft beers all the rage, the draft beer selection is weak. I counted 20 different draft beers, most of which are available anywhere you go (Bud Lite, Sam Adams, etc.) I expected a wider selection of craft brews on tap.
2) I would expect a place that has made such an enormous investment in audio / video equipment would likewise invest in sports programming. I'm sure they'll have the NFL Ticket package, but come on guys, throw us a bone and get the MLB package for the summer. On this night, the Pirates had played during the day and so virtually every tv was showing ESPN programming. I can stay home a see that.

I'm not lying when I tell you I LOVE SWISS CHALET. It is my go-to comfort food and it is always consistent every time. It's been quite some time since I last ate it but I had no doubt that it would not disappoint. Sadly - my expectations were a whee bit high.. both on the food and the service.

There was no one at the counter when I walked in and waited several minutes before anyone showed up. I was watching the cook in the back as he continued to prepare his next order leaving for delivery. The girl was super nice and efficient but I had gotten a little impatient. The store smelled of major BO which made me want to leave as quickly as possible and the space was run down and dirty.

When I finally got home and hoped to enjoy the awesome quarter chicken dinner, I found that the white meat was rather dry, than the usual juiciness, even if it was white meat. The corn (side dish) was also dry, and over cooked - pretty sure it was microwaved. Surprisingly, the chalet sauce seemed rather salty (maybe it's just my tastebuds), but overall... a sub par dinner that I had high hopes for.

I am SO sorry to say this, but I've been hiding a lil gem all to myself. China Buffet is my all-time favorite chinese food buffet. We're always greeted with a smile and a nice autmosphere, I like the sing-songy contempo chinese pop in the background, it's not too loud so it's good. 

The dining area is vast and is always kept clean. The uniformed staff are always on the ball - clearing plates as soon as you take your last bite and always offer to refil drinks.

The food is very very good. I love the bbq pork. The sesame chicken & beef n broccoli are favorites of mine as well. Their wonton soup is super yummy! I always start every meal a nice bowl of a couple of 'tons. lol. 

But the real attraction for me is the Sushi Bar!! Their sushi is real hit or miss... but is more hit than miss... and since it comes with the meal - it's worth atleast taking a gander at. Their salmon nigiri is always good when in stock, as is their shrimp nigir - but I have had a couple of pieces of bad tuna nigiri, which disappoints me but I still go back and give it a go. When tipped well - the sushi chef will make things to order. The sushi isn't the best in the city - by far, but it is good. 

I've taken a lot of people to China Buffet and everyone liked it except for one friend who thought their abolone was gross... but abolone IS gross... regardless of where it comes from. 

And so i say unto you, my fellow yelpers please forgive me for keeping this place a secret. I hope you try China Buffet and enjoy your visit.

I had the Strawberry..
Both of my little sisters had Taro..
We all had boba in them


Sister 1 did not like the little boba and wanted to exchanged it for a different drink.

I then walked up to the employee and discussed a few business ethics and standards that AZ and USA operate at a normal basis.  With his broken english he refused any refund or exchange transaction....I thought to myself...all this for what... for his poorly made product? Pick and choose your battles.

Sister 2 did not lik the AZ based boba tea store...she wished she was still in Cali. Don't we all.

My dining companion and I went for bowls - she chose the brown rice with Mexican Mole sauce, marinated tempeh and asparagus/beets. Mine was a quinoa with pumpkin-fennel-cashew pur e and grilled zucchini and steamed cauliflower. Both had nice little mache, sprouts and a drizzle of balsamic - a beautiful and well-rounded dish. My only critique would be that the pur e wasn't hot (or even warm) and neither were the veggies and the quinoa was only slightly warm. Consistent temperature (either hot or cold) would have been preferable as it was an odd mix. I'll just be sure to request that next time as regardless everything was delicious and clean-the-plate worthy. 

The service was very warm and the selection of drinks both alcoholic and non was nice - kombucha, tisanes, coffees, smoothies etc. No room for desert but they had coconut-banana and coconut-mango ice and other sundries that were tempting.

aqERrLMMAbhsvZNt6gf2xw,jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q,2013-10-20,2,"Every once in awhile I have a meal at a restaurant that exceeds all my expectations, and it happened recently in of all places, Montreal, Canada.  In a city known for smoked meat and french fries loaded with gravy and cheese I had one of the best meals ever at Propulsion Cantine Vegetalienne. A Vegan restaurant  with an Airplane theme on the famed Saint Catherine's Street.  From the menu to the decor, from the waitress to the owner, this place is funky, fresh and entirely unexpected. Simone and I brought some friends with us who were Vegan and we actually arrived about twenty minutes before closing. I was a little nervous that the service and the food would be sub par because of the time of night but we were happily greeted on arrival by the quirky and funky waitress whose name I cant remember but whose personality I can never forget. She was more then willing to talk our ears off about the entire menu and about their new restaurant that has only been open since mid summer 2013.  The decor is aviation themed including a mannequin of a 1950's pilot and many parts of an actual propeller plane that had crashed and the owner had bought and turned into the bar and some seating tables.  It is all very cool to look at while waiting for the food.  Speaking of food, we decided after speaking with the waitress that we would just let her decide what to eat and so she started us off with a sample of a cool and refreshing cucumber smoothie. From there the four of us split a create your own bowl.  This was a imaginative concept where you choose a combination of grains, vegetables, and sauces. We went with a Pesto Bowl and had Quinoa, Bean Based Pesto, and fresh grilled Zucchini and roasted Cauliflower in it. Although completely dairy free, and thickened with garbanzo beans, this was the best Pesto I have had. It was creamy, nutty and garlicky great. The quinoa and vegetables were cooked perfectly as well and this was a great start to the meal.  Next we wanted to explore the sandwich menu (all sandwiches come with tempeh in them and of course your choice of fresh, moist, light vegan breads) .They all sounded so good our waitress suggested we split a variety of them and she would be sure the kitchen would cut them into portions for us. I didn't think it would get much better after the Pesto but these sandwiches were just over the top great.  The choices we went with were the Lentil Cari sandwich ( my personal favorite), The Mungo Mango ( voted by my friends to be the best), and The Purple Taro Portabello (still good but third on the voting scale). The Lentil Sandwich on Turmeric Bread was tempeh with a lentil patty that had a hint of curry and spice and just the right amount of smokiness, The patty held together on the outside and when you bit in the lentils were cooked perfectly tender but not mushy.  I have never had lentils that tasted so good in my culinary life and the only thing that upset me about this sandwich was that I had to share it with the rest of the table. It was my absolute favorite. Next up was the Mungo Mango. This was also pretty good and consisted of Chinese Mung Beans and Fresh Mango's  with tempeh on Fig Bread...It was earthy and sweet and everyone at the table loved it also. Lastly was the Purple Taro Portabello.  It was also good (and very purple) with mashed taro and sauteed mushrooms with tempeh but I found it to be a little soggy and less flavorful then the other sandwiches.  By the time we ate all the food it was past closing but when we asked the waitress if she wanted to cash us out to help with closing she told us not to worry about it and then she went and ate her own dinner.  We ended up staying for awhile longer and chatting amongst ourselves and with her and it was only when the kitchen (and pilot outfitted owner) had started to leave that we got our check. On the way out we took some vegan cookies with us for the road and they of course were great.  That night I dreamed of Lentil Sandwiches and so the next night Simone and I went back for another helping of sandwiches, pesto and good conversation with our friendly waitress. There was also a great piano player that second night who was amazing and we ended up staying again until closing. Everything about Propulsion is five stars, in the future they will be adding Vegan alcoholic drinks and fresh local salads. I hope that people check this place out because it truly is a hidden gem and I hope that I will have the pleasure of many return visits when I travel to Montreal.",0,5,7B0qcp3pQw-zoGNySmYRqw,review,0

gSf8WXM6xcaRrubtddN07A,6A9aTa0F0OBctMg_yNAOOA,2010-09-19,2,"Let's be clear: this place is horrible.

I'll cut to the chase, because its unforgivable. We ordered a couple apps and a couple cocktails. As I was eating a sweet potato won-ton, I bit into a large chunk of dirty plastic that had obviously come from piece of machinery used to prepare these over-fried pieces of tasteless, greasy cardboard (on a side note, it was served with some sort of ""spicy Thai"" sauce, which is really a scoop from some giant vat of mass produced combination of soy sauce, fake ginger, and MSG). 

When I told the server with a shocked face, he seemed so indifferent and complacent that it was almost some sort of a normal occurrence to him. ""Oh, okay,"" as he took the plate away without any question. I asked for the bill immediately, and when he returned with it later, he told me he had removed the offending item so that we wouldn't be charged.

Listen... I just chomped down on a piece of machinery and it hurt. Don't think you're being some generous prince by knocking the thing off the bill. I gave him less money than the total -- basically enough to cover the drinks -- and told him that's all he was getting. Again, no reaction.

Here's where I tell you that the menu sucks; the crab cakes taste like they came from MM Meatshop; the stale olives in the martini tasted like aluminium. The only saving grace was the readily available boxes of Trivial Pursuit cards, which quickly lost their novelty.

This is what concerns me most: we came here because people on Yelp said it was decent. Trust us, and just walk a few doors down to Volo instead. They're pricks, but at least they have great beer.",0,1,DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg,review,0

I arrive late to meet with lovely ladies Chris P and Elaine K as they are conveniently seated at the very first table which is seperated from the entrance by a large glass pane. The  atmosphere is intimate and laid back as they had a little fireplace going completely decked out in tinsel and Christmas regalia.  

The menu is a concise offering of delectable comfort foods.  I order the Butternut squash cakes to share which is 3 pieces, Panko Breaded with Corn and Red Peppers, served with sour Cream spiked with scotch bonnet peppers. The cakes are delightfully crisp and savoury and nicely complimented by the tangy vinagrette marinated cucumber strings.

The ladies order their respective meals and I order the Green salad with poppy seed dressing topped with grilled chicken and I have to declare it is the best salad I have had in a long time as the warm chicken along with the fresh greens and flavourful poppy seed dressing is a medley of deliciousness happening in my mouth.

The meal was actually pretty reasonably priced as the total for 1app a big salad and two entrees came to about $56!

Kudos and thanks to the lovely Chris P for choosing such a great cozy spot for a lazy rainy Monday dinner get-together. I highly recommend Local 4 for that perfect little place to escape for a pint, some good food and good conversation.",0,4,DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg,review,2

For having to be somewhere after dinner, the chunk of time the overall experience of dining here took really took away from the fact that the food was really good. 

However slow speed is not the only reason local 4 receives 3 stars, the overall atmosphere in here is not really my thing, with plain tables and chairs and nothing spectacular done. It's a simple bar, friendly staff and I know if I lived around the area, local 4 would be my go to place for drinks and good food. But since I don't, while the beer selection is OK and the food is great, I doubt I will come here often. It is definitely worth repeat visits though. The menu is a little on the pricey side as well, but at least the food is good.

The falafel was possibly the best I've had and the chicken quesadilla is also great. You add free board games in to the mix and this is a place that everyone definitely needs to visit for a not too fancy exprience.

They serve top-notch pub fare alongside some quality beers (but needs to be more seasonal, lagers and pale ales just don't satisfy in the dead of winter and they were out of the oatmeal stout. nb: Guinness in a can doesn't count as stout, or a beer for that matter) and just happened to fit my craving for comfort food on a really cold night perfectly.

I had a wonderful meal starting with their delicious butternut squash crab cakes, which were served with a scotch bonnet aioli that had no scotch bonnet in it.  While it was a puzzling omission, it was a lovely starter. For my supremely comfortable entree, I had the beef bourguignon, which was a hearty stew of button mushrooms, thick-cut carrots, cippolini onions and tender chunks of beef with what the chef likes to call ""pear mashed potatoes"".  This blew me away when it was served, and I thought it was unique, clever and bloody delicious. They take a heaping mound of mashed and shape it like a giant pear, and then quickly deep fry it, and top it with a whole clove as the stem. I had to smile and marvel at its elegant construction before I hungrily devoured my plate. I splurged on some sticky toffee pudding for dessert as the meal was so perfectly hitting all of my gastrogenous zones, and it did not disappoint. It was a large piece and while they were a bit light on the caramel sauce, my waistline didn't need any more abuse on this particular occasion. Everything was perfect, and it was just what I needed on a windy and oh-so-cold night. 

The atmosphere and decor are wonderful, it feels really comfortable and homey in there. Also, the music deserves some kudos, they were playing some bad-ass underground hip hop when we got there which transitioned to the entire Led Zeppelin's Early Days album.

Service was fantastic, however, we were one of 2 tables when we arrived, so I would expect fairly undivided attention.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable and ensured that I will certainly consider Local 4 again in the future.  The prices are reasonable given the high quality of the food, and if my only complaint is a lack of beer menu, that's a forgivable sin and a common gripe of mine.

HXWA4q4g0G8-H67KTkEw8Q,SGNrvvtPAnNRfnWeCaiWuw,2010-09-03,2,"I went to Local 4 last night with my boyfriend and could not have been more disappointed. First of all, it was August and it had rained, so we opted to sit inside. The a/c wasn't turned on, so it was hot and muggy despite the ceiling fans. They proceeded to turn on the a/c which couldn't possibly have been working because we were still sweating. 

We ordered the sweet potato fries ($8) and the artichoke dip ($9) as appetizers. First of all, for the price of the appetizers, we were expecting A LOT more than a small plate of fries and a ramekin of dip. The ""crostini"" that came with the dip was inedible...literally. They were burnt and rock hard that they were impossible to bite into. I asked for some pita bread instead which was softer, but had been ""grilled"" which gave it a burnt taste - likely the result of a grill that is not cleaned very often. The sweet potato fries were slightly undercooked and were served with a watery chipotle mayo (great flavour, but thin consistency.)

For entrees I ordered the falafel which is touted on the menu as being the ""best in the city"" and for $13, I had pretty high expectations. Let me just say that for $5.99 I could've had TWO falafels, double the size, just down the street. and i'm sure they would've been much better tasting. 

My boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich with fries. I liked the fries, but he said the sandwich was only okay.

Overall, the food barely deserves even one star. It's over-priced and borderline inedible. The atmosphere is lacking...not much to it, but not in a new-age minimalist way. I would describe it as drab. I WILL say that the service was friendly and I also have to mention that I did like the plates they use (straight out of the '70's).",1,1,DSKIdpJY_XCL_QMp1bpIrg,review,0

I was the designated child care for my new step-granddaughter this afternoon so I said, ""Hey, let's go out to lunch!""  We headed for Andrew's 2nd location on Southern near Dobson.  First impression--specious, clean, bright, cheerful. 

 The Kids Meal seemed a little high at $5 till I saw what she got--about ten little mini corn dogs (she only ate two, though she liked them, just eats like a bird), huge pile of excellent fries, and drink of choice (chocolate milk). The mini corn dogs were fixed really well, deep fried like little fritters, crunchy and crisp.  I got a BBQ pulled pork sandwich on a hamburger bun with one side (cole slaw) also for $5.  The pork was tender and non-greasy, had wonderful mild flavor, and the BBQ sauce, which you pump as much as you want out of a big jug, had great flavor.  There was a spicier version available if you preferred. Cole slaw was very good--I forgot to ask if it was homemade by them but it tasted like it could be.

The girl behind the counter was very cheerful and didn't rush me in choosing.  She said she usually works at the Guadalupe location but I'm glad she was here today.

The chips are delicious, and it's all a generous portion. It only took about 10 minutes for them to get our order to us, which was to go. You can sit in, and the space is warm and comfortable, and they make it very evident that this is supposed to be a Scottish establishment.

We got our table around 7:30pm, but it took another 30 minutes for the waiter to take our order.
The quality of the food was ok: the do-r -mi appetizer was very good, but the salmon tartar was very salty. The ribs were good (could have more vegetables on the side), but there was way too much salt and clove in the meat pie. You don't need that much salt when the flavours are good to begin with.

But the worst part was that at 10pm (remember, they took our order at 8pm), slightly after we paid, the waiter asked if we thought of leaving soon because another group was waiting for our table ! Of course, he waited after we paid his 15% tip to ask us to leave. We were finished and would probably had left 5 minutes later, but it's the first time anyone at the table has every been asked to clear the table at a restaurant.

A near-400$ bill for a table of four, took an hour before our order was taken, salty food, and being asked to leave the table 15 minutes after dessert is served... There are too many good restaurants in the area (graziella, local, l'appart, helena, ...) to go back to this grange !

To the owner: booking three services on the same table for a night without enough staff to allow for a quick service, no hostess and no manager on a saturday night might be you're idea of a profitable restaurant, but count me out.

A down-to-earth, friendly server invited us into the restaurant while we were loitering at the door, looking at the menu.  ""C'mon in and give us a try,"" she said, ""We make all our food fresh to order and have something for everyone.""  It was a hard invitation to resist, although we did note that the restaurant was mostly empty at 7:30 on a Saturday night.  So maybe not for everyone?

She quickly brought fresh bread, sun-dried italian olives and olive oil and balsamic vinegar for the table.  Nice opening.  We're starting to wonder why more people aren't populating this lovely place.  The menu is pretty standard with pizzas, pastas and mains.  The soup of the day is a cold gazpacho.  I brazenly ignore the fact that it's a spanish dish and order it, along with a pizza.  My husband orders a squash agnolatti with a tomato basil sauce.  I thought that was an odd combo (I'm more of a brown butter and sage person with squash-filled pasta myself), but it sounded good.

The gazpacho arrives quickly and it is delicious - bright and creamy tasting (maybe some olive oil inside?).  

But the mains were strangely put together.  My pizza had a perfectly chewy thin crust, but the toppings looked and tasted bland (except for the very good olives).  It oddly had very little flavour and the cheese was cheap tasting and heavy.  It was like Pizza Pizza meets Pizza Libretto.  Weird.

The pasta dish had the same problem.  The sauce was delicious.  Very rich and flavourful - like you'd expect from a high-end restaurant.  But the pasta itself was overcooked and the filling had the density of the spackle we are using to patch the walls of our new house.  No flavour at all and leaden.  What's going on here?

My recommendation is if you're in the area and in the mood for Italian, yes, give it a try. I can't say I'd visit again given the endless restaurants in the city I still long to visit but I'm still happy I gave it a try. 
My friend chose the carpaccio to start, then trout, and tiramisu for dessert. I opted for the mussels, pizza, and chocolate mousse cake.

Likes:
-Oil and vinegar brought with bread
-Mussels were amazing!
-Pizza was delicious; definitely give it a try!
-Service was very pleasant; I especially appreciated the knowledge of the wine from the main lady working that evening 
-Ambience is pleasant, but nothing fancy or exciting

Dislikes:
Quality of bread - Boring, bland, old bun. I expected something with my texture and definitely fresher
Carpaccio was flavourless - would never order this again
Coffee was offered after our desserts were served (Personal pet peeve of mine; I like my coffee there when my dessert arrives. Who wants to stare at their dessert while they wait for their coffee to be served?)

In no particular order, let's count some ways that make this place the worst attempt to copy Chipotle ever:

1.) They were out of pico de gallo;
2.) They were out of lettuce;
3.) The food server picked the salsa and sour cream bottles out of a container with melted ice and the water from the bottle dripped all in the burritos and rice bowl as the items were poured;
4.) The food server continually touched the tortilla to her filthy shirt as she made the burrito;
5.) The food tasted stale and the salsa was not good;
6.) The bowl was almost the same price as Chipotle yet it was half the size;
7.) There weren't any other customers and the servers stared at me while I ate; and
8.) They didn't have any type of sign for visibility.

A $9 ""meal for two"" Groupon brought me here.  The pictures were grossly misrepresented on Groupon.

The girl was very smug and replied, the difference is we make all our own food.  Hmmm, ok, well let's give you a try.  We wanted a chicken burrito and a chicken salad.   The girl was slowly making quesadillas one at a time, and said our order would be a while. When our order arrived, the salad was tiny and all thrown together. The burrito was supposed to have guacamole, and had a tiny bit in one end. Beans were undercooked and tasteless.  Rice was bland and resembled minute rice from a box. Chicken had no identifiable flavor at all. We were not impressed with the food, atmosphere, ie wwf smack down really loud, or the food.

First of all, the first time we went they were out of guacamole, lettuce and cilantro.
The staff was super friendly so I decided to give them another shot today. 

Today they were out of straws and medium sauce. *sigh*The salsa was good but the beans were really hard and my tortilla was burnt. I had to pay $2 extra for guacamole and there wasn't hardly any in there.

1)  There is some stiff damn competition in this neighbourhood.  If you're looking for a place where two people can get a delicious, unpretentious meal for under $50, you've got Churrasco of St. Clair, Stockyards, Mezzetta, and Vannis - and that's all within 50 meters of the corner of St. Clair & Christie.  If you're willing to go another block or two, you've got great Mexican and good Indian, too.  

2)  You're selling burgers across the street from Stockyards.  Yes, Chuck had better seating and a liquor license, but the food wasn't as good and there wasn't much of a price difference.  

3)  The ambiance was all wrong for this neighbourhood.  Did I call it ""nouveau abbatoir"" in my earlier review?  I should have.  If I'm looking for a haven after a long day at work, I don't want  bare bulbs and an interior that looks like it was designed for easy hosing off.

It's a shame - the staff were always really nice, and the burgers weren't bad.  I hate to see a place go under in my area, but the mix was just wrong.

I dropped by for takeout poutine on election night; the place was dead silent, and I was a bit uncomfortable as I waited for my junk food.  The stench of death was on the place already.

Looked like a nice place, but oddly, completely empty.  That's always a worry, but we went anyway.  Apparently, they won a prize for best burger in Toronto Life, so must be okay.  Noticed that they fry burgers on a griddle instead of char broiling though.  Odd for a real burger place.  Isn't frying a burger a bit like boiling toast?

So we ordered.  I had the award winning Montreal Burger which featured smoked meat.  We also had a Juicy Lucy which has mozzarella inside it and a portobello mushroom burger.  We ordered some fries which arrived first, like a  starter, which was odd.  They were good, but fries are meant to go with a burger.  That's basic burger stuff to me.  The burgers arrived after we finished the fries completely.

The portobello burger had two small and limp mushrooms rather than a nice big one, so that was disappointing.  They were pretty greasy too.  My Montreal burger was okay, but as it was fried, not a great flavour to me.  The buns were kind of heavy, so I didn't like them too much either.  The Juicy Lucy was missing the cheese completely, so back it went.  It arrived a bit later and it had the cheese but also a kind of funny smell and taste.  It seemed to us like the meat might be too old.  I didn't like it at all and the others didn't have this taste or smell, so that was worrying.

So, I guess I know why it was completely empty when we arrived and when we left.  Service was charming and friendly, but that's kind of small potatoes.  These were not good burgers.",0,1,3HS2__ozuvgbEn-MSyVzQQ,review,0

Thick cut bacon was an excellent side. VERY good bacon. Almost like beef jerky.

Fries were tiny shoe-string, tepid, and dry. Not great.

E-Tea is somewhat small but has a large counter where they serve different types of bubble teas, iced-coffees, Italian soda's etc. My intention was to buy some bubble tea supplies for home but the guy working there did not have any. Instead, he directed me to Asian markets around the area where I could find some; I thought that was really nice and helpful.

After looking over the gigantic beverage menu, I decided upon a mango bubble tea. The bubble teas here are made out of powder and come in one standard sized cup. I paid around $3.77 for a cup which was about 14oz. The drink was refreshing and the tapioca was cooked perfectly. However, the mango flavor did not taste too much like mango which was disappointing.

Wir wollten spontan in Waiblingen essen gehen und ich erinnerte mich an einen Zeitungsberricht von der Er ffnung des Mang vor einigen Monaten/Jahren...also gegoogelt...gefunden...hingefahren. Es waren nur 6 Tische belegt und wir hatten freie Auswahl. Man empfahl uns einen Tisch auf der oberen Ebene, alles war gut. Speise- u. Getr nkekarte kamen sofort. Wir orderten gr nen Tee mit frischem Ingwer und ein Flasche 0,5 ltr. ""Edelwasser""...blaue Flasche heimisches Wasser zu edlem Preis.
Bedienung
Die Chefin bedient selbst, sehr aufmerksam und bestimmt. F r meinen Geschmack ist Ihr Blickkontakt und Augenaufschlag etwas viel...Sp ter fiel mir auf, mit welch affektiertem Gehabe ein Gruppe ""prominenter"" G ste verabschiedet wurde.
Das Essen
Wir bestellten als Vorspeise einmal die Sommerrolle, gebratenes H hnchen in Tashi-Curry sowie die knusprige Ente in vietnamesischer Kokossauce. Die Rollen waren sehr klein und enthielten nur flaue Glasnudeln mit sehr wenig Kr utern und einer hauchd nnen Garnelenscheibe. Auch der Hoisin-Sauce fehlte der Pfiff. Diese Rollen kenne ich viel besser, mache sie seit einem Vietnam-Kochkurs auch selber.Die Currys waren beide sehr schmackhaft. Alle zutaten sehr frisch, nichts verkocht und die Sauce sch n s mig.Das Entencurry war etwas sehr knapp bemessen, ebenso der Reis zu den Gerichten. Damit stimmt das Preis-/Leistungsverh ltnis leider nicht ganz.
Das Ambiente
Das Ambiente ist sehr ansprechend, wirkt beruhigend und stimmungsvoll. Kein asiatischer Plastik-Kitsch usw. Wir f hlen uns sehr wohl..

Meine Freunde und ich, wir waren sehr erstaunt  ber das Ambiente und das angenehme Gef hl w hrend des Essens, auch der Geschmack war wirklich au ergew hnlich. Nach dem Essen wurden wir noch auf einen Pflaumenwein eingeladen. Dannach haben wir die Rechnung kommen lassen (4 Personen knapp 50EUR). Selbstverst ndlich gab es Trinkgeld f r das Personal. Anschlie end haben wir uns bedankt und wurden freundlich verabschiedet. So sind wir dann angenehm ges ttigt nach Hause gegangen. 


Im Gro en und Ganzen ist das MANG sehr empfehlenswert. Zwei Kleinigkeiten k nnten vielleicht noch verbessert werden. Einmal Soft-Drinks gibt es nur in 0,3L Gl sern, diese k nnten vielleicht gr  er ausfallen. Ansonsten k nnten die Gerichte ein bisschen mehr Sch rfe vertragen (das ist meine Meinung), aber ich denke es sind nur einige Kleinigkeiten. ;)

Ich hoffe, dass meine Kritik hilfreich war und der eine oder andere sich bei Gelegenheit dazu entschlie t auch mal das Restaurant zu testen und hier eine Bewertung zu schreiben.

I came across an ad for this place a few days ago at my hairdresser and went to try it today. I was like a kid going up and down the aisles, putting hard to find items like salt fish, sorrel, kola champagne, jerk seasoning, plantain chips and ovaltine biscuits into my basket. It was such a treat to find Caribbean groceries that I had to order online before I knew of Caribbean Market Place. It is a small store but take your time going through...I was surpised at the selection.

After chatting with the lady who rang me up, I learned that the Caribbean Market Place grocery store has been there for 6 years, but they recently opened the kitchen which is adjacent. There are a couple of tables inside and outside, but we opted for an order to go. A generous plate of curry chicken, rice and peas and plantains was $10, oxtail stew with the same sides was $13. VERY good meal! My curry chicken was enough for lunch and dinner...my Dad enjoyed his oxtail with plantains.

Well, by the time I sat down to eat it was a bit underwhelming. Being that I'm originally from Brooklyn, NY I have had many plates of Jamaican food in my lifetime and this one just didn't quite cut it for me.

If you find yourself straying westward one afternoon, stop for lunch at the Caribbean Marketplace on 44th Av & W Northern.  The restaurant is expanding to include more dining space.  I am rooting for it's success.  With expansion, I'm hoping to see more organization and a better use of the displays. 

Overall friendly atmosphere; nice ambiance in the restaurant with music to keep rhythm to.  I'm fond of the tall wood tables and chairs.  They add class to the cheap looking tile floor.  The grill outside was hot, but empty so I presume they only grill upon order. 

The grocery store is small with a few packed aisles.  I saw a bit of everything.  If you need something - ask.  Numerous folks came through to pick up one or two things or just out of curiosity, so this spot is pulling in a good crowd. 

Meanwhile, back in the restaurant, I was happy to have a tall serving of homemade sorrel.  Oh yes, yes, that takes me back....Prepared to wait for the snapper (made to order) I also enjoyed a veggie patty of corn, carrots, and cabbage.  It was the classic veggie patty that I remembered from my other life.  

What I wasn't happy about was the lack of green vegetation on the menu.  Oxtails, chicken, goat, patties (beef, chicken, veggie), coco bread, plantains (way too oily!), rices & peas, pasta salad, and potato salad were readily available.  Where were the greens, callaloo, okra?

Nonetheless, my order of snapper was beautifully prepared with bell peppers and onions.  Yummy.  The cook allowed the veggies to flavor the dish and did not rely on a heavy hand of salt.  I will def come to the Caribbean (1 R, 2 B's) Marketplace again and I do recommend that you stop by too.

Let me know start, the place is located in a small strip mall and wasn't hard to find with my GPS.  The sign outside was large enough to see from far.  
Parking is more than generous.  The outside of the establishment is clean.  

As you enter, I was greeted by the friendly employees.  On the left is the grocery side and on the right is the restaurant side with some tables and chairs for eating.

On this particular visit, we found everything we were looking for that couldn't be found at any local grocery store, Walmart, or Target.  We picked up curry and saffron powder, cooking butter, a soft drink called 'Solo', poulourie mix, and a jar of mango chutney all produced in our homeland - Trinidad and all reasonably priced may I add!

While we were there, we figured we'd grab a bite to eat so I ordered the regular curry goat which comes with 2 sides so I chose the rice and beans along with the fried plantains which was very tasty and served hot!  Thankfully the curry goat wasn't too spicy.  The regular is $`13 and was enough for two or maybe if you leave any leftovers, it can go for dinner tonight but I consumed it all.
One of the food items we came for was roti but they were out but will be retuning in a couple days for it....it's a must have!

As a meat eater myself, it took some convincing by my wife to try O'Bol, which is a 100% vegan restaurant with no animal products whatsoever.

After tasting their Californian salad however, I was truly impressed! The blend of vegetables with ""simulated"" chicken strips that tasted so much better than some real meat strips, topped with a peanut sauce that marries itself so well to the Asian flavours... It was a piece of heaven!

I've returned only once since then as it's out of my regular way and tucked in the Bonaventure Plaza's food court, but just writing this review right now makes me crave for more.

I'm not vegan, but I've always been a sucker for simulated meats. You can imagine how shocked I was when I got there and saw things like ROAST CHICKEN LEG and MEATBALLS on the menu. Talk about doing a complete 180 on your original concept.

But since I went all the way over there, and nothing else in that food court appealed to me, and I'm not even vegan and therefore have no dietary restrictions, I decided that I was going to eat O'Bol anyway.

I went with the french chicken (I think that's what it was called), which was basically a chicken stew with peas and squash, served in a bowl over rice and roasted potatoes. I also had a squash soup. The verdict? It was pretty good for a food court kiosque, and even though it wasn't what I was expecting, I wasn't really disappointed. It's kind of nice to eat something relatively healthy in a food court (and I mean that in comparison to all the other very greasy and oily things you might be forced to eat in this kind of setting).

It's probably about as homey as you can get in a food court.

I know Rascal House pizza is terrible-- weird, sweet crust reminiscent of bisquick, sweet sauce, tasteless toppings.  It was one of three places to eat on Euclid whilst I was taking my Bar Review at CSU (not as fun as it sounds-- bar exam review, not a review of bars).  The other two were an Arby's and a scary greasy spoon.  So I ended up having at Rascal House more times than I care to count.  Imagine having to study for the most important test of your life AND having to eat bad pizza along with it.  The horror.  The horror.

I've had it since then, because downtown firms always seem to order it for working lunches.  It has not improved.

So, here I am, back at CSU to take a few classes.  What to have for lunch.  I'm pretty sick of Subway.  Nothing at the school food service looks good today.  What to get?  A salad.  How hard can a salad be?  Surely Rascal House has a simple, tasty salad.  Most  pizza places do.

Swamp water.  That's what it tasted like.  The lettuce bore the unmistakeable taste of pre-cut, bagged lettuce that had been siting in the cooler for a while until someone opend it and dumped it into a container without washing it.  (I worked at a few dives to put myself through undergrad.  I know how that works.)  The carrot shreds were completly dry and had absorbed whatever scary odors were going around the cooler.  The turkey and ham were both of the ultra processed, parts-is-parts variety. there was about a tablespoon of cheese and two tiny slices of hard boiled egg.  Sad.

A bit heavy on the salt, but all very flavorful.  The linguine was in red clam sauce on the menu, but they were happy to change it to white sauce.  It was huge and very tasty.  I had the penne romanoff which was basically ala vodka. We also had the chicken marsala and the fettucine caprese.  Everything is what you'd expect as textbook Italian food.

The wine menu is pleasant, and they serve free bruschetta. Their bread is also really soft, and served warm - pretty decent table balsamic vinegar. We both ordered pasta, and again, while the service time was a bit long (20 mins for a main dish), we were distracted by the appetizers. The restaurant also delivers on menu ingredients as listed for the dishes (lots of clams, bacon/ham, mushrooms, etc - none of the pretentiousness followed by a paltry portion). The dessert is accompanied with fruit and other sundries. No returned dishes, and well informed staff.

Since we didn't know where else to go in the city and had trekked all the way there with our three kids we said we would wait. I guess they realized they were not getting rid of us that easily and miraculously 5 minutes later there was a table for us. 

The waiter was much nicer and accommodating to our family. He split a dish on to two plates for our kids and put tomato sauce on the side as requested by them. My steak was mediocre. For the size of the steak, about half of it was fat. I would have been more impressed with a small piece of quality steak rather than a gigantic one that you couldn't eat a lot of.

The menu is clearly displayed above the counter, although they have a few more dishes on their takeaway menu if nothing above stands out for you. I ordered a Wazeeri Kabob Dinner.

The food took some time to prepare; maybe ten minutes, wasn't timing it. I imagine they do not do a lot of pre-cooking. I don't mind that at all, but don't expect fast-food service times. As long as the food is good, I think the preparation time was reasonable.

What I got was a fair size salad, which tasted fresh and clean, and I enjoyed. The rice was a sort of pilaf with raisins and cooked shredded carrots, which was fine. I'm not keen on cooked raisins in rice, but it's definitely something lots of people enjoy, so I'll withhold my judgement.

The chicken kabob was the star of the plate. Chicken kabobs are usually cooked to death, dry and unappetizing. This kabob managed to be moist without being undercooked, with slight charring on the corners (pleasantly so). Both kabobs were spiced enough to be interesting without being so spicy that you couldn't really taste the meat. The shami kabob was a nice beef kabob as well, although the chicken kabob really stood out for me.

I also had three pieces of their afghani naan in a little basket. Their naan is clearly popular, I've seen lots of people leaving their attached bakery with armloads of naan bread. I like it well enough, it's hearty, tastes like whole wheat, and well-cooked, but given the choice I'd probably be happier with white puffy indian-style naan. Still, it's good.

It was a bit too much food for me, and I'm a reasonably big eater. I didn't have any trouble finishing it, but it was more than I needed for lunch. The next time around, I'll probably skip the rice, because it was my least favorite part of the meal anyway.

The service was solid, although unexceptional.

I went to Afghan Village once in their older location in the same mall, and it didn't really stand out for me. This visit was something else entirely. I can see from the other reviews that some other people had less pleasing experiences than I did, and I haven't been there often enough to know which experience is more common. However, I will definitely be returning, and perhaps after a few more visits, I'll be able to speak to their consistency.",0,4,-Ag1PS0_G0yGxLWv_pULiA,review,0

We both ordered the Chicken Breast Kabob dinner with rice, salad and naan bread ($9.99). The rice had raisin and shaved carrots in it and it was pretty good, not too dry or overly moist. The salad was somewhat disappointing, didn't seem fresh and really soggy. The main highlight was the chicken breast kabob which was outstanding, perfectly seasoned and flavoured, and very tender. The whole wheat naan bread was lightly toasted and pretty fresh for that time of night.

It was awesome. Three of us went for dinner a couple days ago and we all left stuffed, satisfied and excited to return. The menu is predominately kabobs, meat, and I saw one lamb curry on the back page. 

Two of us sampled the chicken kabob dish and the third person a chicken and beef kabob platter. The meat was succulent, spiced well and flavourful. The dish came with rice that had shaved carrots and raisins which was tasty , a side of salad and amazing nan. 

I noticed people kept coming in the restaurant while we were waiting for our food and leaving with bags of nan to go. The nan at Afghan Village is not like Indian nan, it's whole wheat, a big long oval shape and doughy. Very tasty with our starter (can't remember the name). Although we couldn't breathe we were so stuffed, we had tea and sampled their baklava (a lighter, not overly sweet baklava). I would 100% return for dinner to Afghan village. While the decor is nothing to write home about, the wait staff were really friendly and explained dishes and took an interest that we were in the restaurant. 

On a side note, the restaurant has a small ""retail"" store at the front by the door that carries food products, desserts, nuts and tea from Afghanistan.  Cool place.

The decor is a wide mix of Asian cultures, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, so you almost feel as though its going to be a fusion type of pizza you are going to get. You would be very wrong.
For an appetizer we had the pb egg rolls. It was a nice concept and it tasted great. Only complaints is it didn't have enough spinach inside and it only came with three!

Every bite is full of flavor- you can quickly discern that they use the best quality ingredients.  Somehow they are able to get the toppings on the pizza so you get every topping with each bite, however they don't overload it so the pizza is weighted down with toppings.  The crust is thin and pretty good-I like mine crispy and crunchy and theirs could be a bit more crunchy for my taste.  I ordered a sausage and cheese pizza and their version of Hawaiian, both of which are excellent.  The Hawaiian has roasted pineapple, sliced red jalape o(not too spicy), and their delicious crispy pancetta .  Their sausage is super tasty- they use some excellent quality sausage with fantastic flavor,  they crumble it perfectly so every bite has sausage but not too much.  Great pizza.

The focus is on a ""zen relaxed"" atmosphere, with brick oven pizza and nuances of Asian cuisine (mostly the sides) peppering the menu. 

Atmosphere/Ambiance A - It's trendy casual. Interior is Asian themed with splashes of Asian art on the walls and ceiling. (Love the dragon painted beam) The dining area is small 5 tables of two on each side. You can easily rearrange seating for 2 or more. The middle there's a longer high top table for larger parties. There is also seating in the small bar area at back of restaurant. The atmosphere is pretty relaxed, Easy Rock tunes (Brown Eyed Girl) was playing in the background.  No TV's though. Still it's a nice place for lunch or stop by after work and chill in the small bar area kind of joint.
  
Food B++ -  Now take into account I'm not a big fan of pizza lately. If you ever notice my pix at pizza places I dine at, I order everything but pizza most of the time...lol. But  for first visit sake I had some here.  All the pizzas are themed with Asian names, but toppings are just your average pizza toppings. I had the Ho-Tai(The Happy Buddha)  which was artichoke hearts, spinach, cherry tomatoes, garlic and olive oil. The crust was baked perfect, NY style, not super thin crust though. The ingredients fresh and good quality. The sauce was evenly distributed on pizza. It didn't overpower the cheese and veggies. I enjoyed the pizza.  It made me happy. 
   
I also had the chicken salad. Thin strips of tender white chicken and napa cabbage,and rice noodles, the vinaigrette used was perfect for me, just slightly sweet and not too tangy and evenly tossed in the salad. I will most likely come here just to have this salad for lunch next time.  Along with the Japanese pretzel sticks.  Those were different. Tiny pretzel sticks with garlic infused chili oil to dip. 
 
Prices are in the moderate range, I didn't see any lunch hour or happy hour specials.
  
Service A+ - Friendly and efficient. For being open just a few days, service far out exceeded my expectations.  My server was knowledgeable about menu items and was able to answer my questions. The owner Mark also came by and followed up and chatted with me. He takes great pride and rightfully so with his new place.  Loves everything about Hawaii and the shave ice served here is inspired by Matsumoto's.  It's not quite like shave ice from the 808, but nice attempt with the Azuki (sweet red beans) and vanilla ice cream.

The other fun touches....The Wish Book! When you are presented with your check at the end, you get a Smartie candy and a little booklet where you get to write your wish and insert it in the wish keeper that's displayed in the middle of dining area.

The truth about Pizza Buddha?  It's a new pizza joint that opened last month in Henderson and I love it!  It's not a very big place, but it packs a lot of punch, just like Pacquiao (except he got knocked out decisively after dinner, but I digress).  Before the Big Fight, my friend and I had dinner at PB and thoroughly enjoyed our first visit.  I say first because we'll definitely be back.  The name of the restaurant may lead one to believe that they serve some kind of weird Asian pizza combinations, but it's not like that, my friends.  There exists a Buddhist theme to the place, from the Asian decor to the names of the menu items, but the specialty pizzas are creative, not Asian, per se.  My date and I chose to create our own and settled on a large mushroom, pancetta, and shaved garlic pizza.  We ordered the PB Egg Rolls appetizer to start, which were 3 large egg rolls filled with ricotta and spinach.  Served steaming hot with a side of marinara sauce, they were tasty and I told our waiter he should have brought us 4 so we didn't have to split the 3rd one.  Our pizza arrived not too long after and we both agreed it was Buddha-licious, not greasy at all with a good-karma inducing crust and soul-soothing sauce.  I had two slices because I wanted to leave room for the dessert, shaved ice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, azuki beans, and your choice of root beer, orange, or cherry flavor.  We chose the root beer and this would be my only gripe about the evening:  there was not enough root beer for all the shaved ice, as more than half of it was just ice with none of the root beer.  Don't order the dessert expecting Snow Ono-quality.  Our bill was served with Smarties candy and a Wish book for each of us to write down a wish and place it in the Wish Maker near the entrance.  Our waiter was fantastic, helpful in terms of the menu and attentive throughout the entire meal, genuinely positive and friendly.  My wish for you is that you get yourself to Pizza Buddha and enjoy the experience as we did.  Peace out.",3,4,0C4b8LsgLuL7_DuPXE729A,review,0

Great variety of appetizers that you wouldn't find in your typical pizza place, or

We had the mozzarella squares & mushroom sliders for appetizers. 
The mozzarella was topped with pesto sauce and tomatoes. Great flavor, however it was served warm to cold, not hot.
Now to the mushroom sliders, one of the best appetizers I have ever had.. Portabello mushroom grilled and topped with pickled vegetables and an asian sweet sauce served on a soft bun. 2 per order.. They should do 3 or 4 with a side and serve it as an entree... So good..you want more.. 

We ordered a cheese pizza for the kids and a pepperoni & sausage for the adults. 
Thin crust pizza with a tasty tomato sauce, cheese, sausage and I like the way they do the pepperoni, its in thin strips and not cut in circles. Both delicious

I just wanted a burger.  And a beer.  And McDonalds doesn't serve both ;)

I immediately liked the decor and ambiance at Oh Burger, and as a party of two we seated ourselves at a little table to the left of the bar.  The restaurant was not incredibly busy but busy enough that most tables and a few bar stools were accounted for. 

The waitress was very friendly, our order was taken and the drinks arrived quickly.  Our food was delivered by a very personable man whom we assumed was the manager.

I had the 8oz bison burger with mushrooms, a side of fries and Sapporo (a damn good Japanese beer!). I have to admit it wasn't the greatest burger that I've ever had, but what I really appreciated was that it was not dripping with grease and the toppings were fresh and delicious.  The. Fries. Were.

There was about 12ppl waiting to order and 7ppl waiting for their food.  The grill guy seemed flustered and the guy adding toppings and condiments was loudly calling out people's names.  Overall it took almost 20min to get my food.  

I ordered the classic w/ cheese combo w/ fries.  I found the burger to be a bit dry and chewy.  Definitely not juicy. The fries were soggy - they were definitely not fresh from the fryer.  The onion rings were just the way I like - battered not breaded and super crispy.

lotta beers on tap, this is definitely the kind of place to meet up weekend late night with some hungry friends and chow down/get hammered ($11 pitchers). apparently they're starting to do live music too.

They started off strong amongst the slowly crowding burger scene in Toronto and kinda died off. I'm not sure if it's simply the sheer number of new places always popping up or if quality has gone down since the doors first opened.

From the few times I've been, they have been pretty consistent.  I mean their burgers have never been the best as they would have liked to proclaim or the early reviewers would have suggested.  On this occasion I dropped by Oh Boy with Angela for lunch. I ended up ordering the cheese burger combo for just 9.95. I upgraded and got the sweet potato fries and onion rings with an iced tea. I topped it with the traditional toppings with ketchup and mayo. Angela got a Hawaiian burger with an iced tea.  She also opted for the traditional toppings with ketchup.

Now the burger is a solid burger. It's meaty and has a decent flavour to it. I like how it's not overly done so the moisture is still there. The amount of fries and onion rings were huge. I mean I love the portion sizes at oh boy. I come here knowing I'll be hitting a food coma when I'm done.  The sides weren't as strong as it has been in the past.  The crispiness wasn't there for the sweet potato fries and the onion rings were a little worse than their usual.  So definitely a little disappointing and I can see why there's a drop from their initial launch.  Angela liked her burger and like me, felt it was a solid all around burger.  I guess for the both of us it was disappointing to see oh boy go. The place was pretty much a pub which specialized in serving burgers.  They had the bar at the back with flat screens but I guess it just didn't work out in the end.

Overall, I liked oh boy. It's nothing out of the extraordinary, but sometimes all you want is a familiar taste at pretty reasonable prices. I'm a huge believer of leaving a restaurant full. Love that satisfying feeling and knowing that I got a good bang for my buck.  With it closing, I can only hope for another burger joint to take its place.  A place that will also provide a similar feel and bang for my buck. Thank you oh boy, I have always left needing to past out sooner than I think.",1,3,1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw,review,1

It was a  cold night though (my new venturing always seems to happen on cold days) and though I was weary about the fact that there was only a big man sitting in the booth looking outwards and nobody else in the restaurant - I went in for some good ol' pub food.

I had a milkshake and Chorico Burger with poutine as a side(can you believe that?!!), which came to about $15. 
When the milkshake came, I thought , well that's about what it's worth - it turns out there was not enough of the shake, I found myself rationing it so it will last longer. It was GREAT....it wasn't orgasmic, but it was pretty close.

Then our waitress brought us our sides - in a bowl by itself - and I thought OMG if this is the size of ""sides"" I scared about size for meals -  the portions were ENORMOUS for a side - it was more of a meal.
The food came, and it filled the whole table - I barely managed to finish my delicious burger (which I sort of forced to eat by the end, cuz I wasn't leaving none behind) and took my untouched poutine to go.
I believe this is the only time I felt like I was paying too little for the food I was getting - the proportions were like Chinese restaurant proportions - you get $2 worth of food for $1.

Let me start by saying that I mean this not in the way a child expresses delight at finding a much wanted toy under the Christmas tree, but more in fact the shock of seeing a train wreck unfold before your eyes...

Upon entering, one sign told us to go order at the counter which we attmpted only to be redirected to be served at the back of the restaurant.
In the interest of speed, my dining companion and I chose the bar to look forwad to our first foray into what was surely to be one of Toronto's finest burger experiences.

We tried to order a couple of beer, only to be told by our self admittedly hung over waitress that they were ""mostly out"".  We were offered (for free to be fair), the dregs of a keg, and subsequently switched to one of the few beers they had left.

Recommendations were sought from our server - you know for an empty restaurant, she was sure a long time between visits.

I chose the highly recommended three cheese burger, while my companion chose a pure offering, one with fries, one with rings.

The burgers arrived (eventually) with no discussion about how they should be cooked at all...

My process cheese crusted to the top of a greasy, tateless, salt lick accompanied by freezer burnt greasy onion rings was difficult to stomach and required additional beer to get it down.

The natural burger was equally disappointing, and the french fries, soggy and over salted.

There's really not much point in pining on about the other shortcomings.

As we left with our stomachs wanting, our wallets emptier than they should have been, and considerably more time elapsed than reasonable, we couldn't help but wonder:

Well, she walked by 6 or 7 times over the next 15 minutes making eye contact but otherwise completely ignoring us. The bartender was chatting with another employee and didn't notice we had not been served. 

Finally my boyfriend went up and placed our order at the take-out counter. The employee there apologized and said she would bring us our orders. The orders came but we had to flag her down again to ask for cutlery and napkins.

Living on King St W has his benefits, and usually a burger craving would send us to Craft Burger, good 'ol faithful -- but tonight, we strayed. With great regret ...

It's 7pm. 
Thursday evening. Even though we'd checked this site for reviews (which were scattered at best) we thought we'd give it a go. Mid week, later in the evening. Give it the benefit of the doubt.

The place was still busy. 
But really, just full of a few people sitting-in to eat. We drove there, to check the place out, and place our take-out order in person - less chance of error ... riiiiiiiiight?!?  
The 2 guys behind the counter were talking a lot of sh*it ... which we noticed right off when we walked in. They weren't young, but they were extremely 'young' acting, and immature. 
We kinda knew what we were in for, but decided to continue in .. 
 
The 'girl behind the cash' was a mid-aged-overly-made-up blonde girl, who looked lovely, but didn't have much rattling around in her head. 
We placed our orderr: a little oh boy combo (there version of 2 sliders & 1 side (fries) & drink) and a Hog Town Combo (w/fries) and a single order of Onion Rings. 


So, as we're waiting, we watch these 2 guys (I'll call them Griller #1 & Griller #2) huddled behind a very very small work space & exposed grill, that's publically displayed, so we can watch the exciting grilling action - kinda cool, right? 
No, not really. 
Because of the heat, it was just a fogged up mess. 
But after witnessing what little we did, I highly doubt they'll want to advertise what goes on behind there! 

My boyfriend then notices the box of burgers, on the floor. Just sittin' there. 
We then watch, a guy come to pick up his order, and confirm his request of 'NO MAYONNAISE'. Griller #1 behind the counter, then looks at the burger in his hand, that he had just squired a load of mayo on. Noticing his mistake (and the guy who had requested it), he throws the burger to one side, and accepts a 'fresh' burger from Griller #2. And he re-makes his burger. This time with no mayo.
Griller #2 must see potential for resale (!), so he starts scraping the mayo off .. and throws it back on the grill!!!
AHHHHH!!
Griller # 1 & Griller #2 were definite loud mouths - they were swearing, and making fun of how bad their service was - they were joking about drug use *including being under the influence* .. just the weirdest crap I'd ever heard spewing out ... and completely unprofessional. 


We also witnessed them re-frying food.
fries specifically.  
 

Our food was 'ready' - 
So. We never got the single order of onion rings. We didn't notice this until we got home, and inspected our dinner. 
That, after we had watched the one Griller get in 'trouble' from the other Griller, for serving 'too many onion rings' in an order. 
Makes one wonder ...

So, for $32.21 - failed & incomplete order
 .75 cents - 20 minutes of parking, 
Oh Boy! Did we get ripped off.


This all happened while we were there.
I'm actually not even done my meal, but wanted to write this review while it was so fresh in my mind.

I can't lay claim to Chris ""burger baron"" P.'s bona fide burger-bonanza breadth, but I've had a few burgers in my time.  This was the best one I can remember.

I was treated well from the minute I walked in the door, which itself took some effort - use the middle door instead of trying and retrying the side ones in front of a crowd (like I did).  Had a good laugh and a warm welcome from two staff waiting on the inside before catching up with waiting friends Kat ""the app for that"" F. and the aforementioned burger baron.

I was greeted by the lovely and charming Vharay who advised on burger selection and beer offerings before provisioning a promptly pulled pint and a business card (as I had suggested that she didn't really have one).  I ordered the Oh Boy Classic with 3 Cheese combo, with a half-and-half fries and onion rings (it's not on the menu, although I think it should be, so don't count on this).  They have Mill Street Tankhouse on tap, and I indulged.  

The burger came OEM with lettuce, tomato, guacamole, and a good slice each of cheddar, swiss and havarti.  Aftermarket options exist, but the stock version sounded good enough already.

And it was.

8 ounces of AAA ground chuck, grilled to perfection and juicier than a Georgia peach in full season.  The guacamole had a creamy texture and flavour that added a high note to the gooey cheesy goodness, yet somehow through all that rich flavour the patty still managed to shine through and remind me why I was there in the first place.  I was in heaven for the three minutes that burger lasted in my hands.

The onion rings were fantastic - just a really well-made, classic ring.  Fries were thin-cut, which Is great for flavour, but they get cold fast (eat them first).  They were also perfectly salted.

well for a hefty price like that, it fell very short.  firstly, there was no mill street left.  no one has to go business school or ever work in a restaurant to know that if you dont have it available, DONT ADVERTISE IT.  i had to mention it to them to remove the sign, which they did.  

the waitresses serving me were very nice, patient and understanding.  i settled for a sleemans, which was offered to me at a mere three bucks (here the ""mere"" is meant for real).

i imagine that they are required to cook a burger to a certain doneness for legal reasons or some such, but when you have to load it up with mayo and heinz dijon (low quality for sure) just so you can stomach it, there is a problem.

Of course I brought Kat F. with me so she could ge the low-down on this place too.

Joey's a great guy and we learned some interesting things about him and Oh Boy!

1.  Before starting the Oh Boy! project Joey had hair (picture 80's hair band), but has a head now more resembling Mr. Clean
2.  Joey claims that he's ""old, like really old"", but doesn't look a day over 30.
3.  The Oh Boy! name stems from a diner in Toronto that no longer exists and is going to be a brand that says they're serious about what they do but still have fun doing it.
4.  It took a year to get Oh Boy! up and running due to the building almost falling over and new structural elements needing to be implemented.
5.  Joey picked the Queen Street location to be close to the entertainment district without needing to be in the middle of all the hype of the ED.
6.  Oh Boy! was started to give people a better experience to enjoy a burger.  Joey describes the experience as coming to the restaurant and enjoying premium quality ingredients while hanging out with friends, and grabbing a beer while the game plays in the background.

Upon this return to Oh Boy! I was even more impressed just due to the fact that they have Okanagan Springs on tap.  It was also great to see that they're working through the growing pains and things are coming together for them.

I got the Portobello burger, which is hopefully the healthiest 'burger' on the menu.  The topping options are all very similar to Hero Burger.  But, the sauces at Oh Boy are all free, including Guacamole!  I thought I had loaded it up with a variety of sauces and toppings, but when it came out it looked kind of puny due to Shrinkage of the 'bello.  The Chipotle BBQ sauce is not very spicy, but is very tasty. The Lettuce is no cheap ice-berg from a bag, it's good quality boston lettuce. 
They have a few kinks to work out, but now is the time to go, because this place is going to get packed. On this First Sunday afternoon, there was hardly any room to sit. The front area is full of booths as is the back. In the middle there are a row of stools to sit on. 
The back bar area is surrounded by TV's showing football and I can see this being a huge thing- bar, bar stools, booths and burgers.  
I also tasted the poutine. The fries are on the small side, which is nice. But the gravy is very beefy and reminds me of the City Hall truck's gravy. This could be a good thing, but it's pretty low on my list of faves in the city.  The food is decent, the atmosphere is wicked and late night line ups are certain.

The burgers didn't disappoint. I had the ""Hog Town"" combo, which included the classic patty along with 2 types of bacon, onion rings, and a drink. I bought a pint of their local ale, which was a perfect compliment. All of it was amazing. I wouldn't change a thing.

What was hilarious was how proud she was that she had remembered to write down the beers on tap, so she could read it back to us. I think she was new to the place, so I'm willing to give her a second chance.

(sigh) The previous reviews just went all over the place and I wasn't so sure what to expect but when my brother burger reviewer Chris P. sang the praises of the beef on a bun at Oh Boy I thought that they would be all that and a bag of chips. 

I had appointments on Camden Street this morning so on my way out I thought I'd grab a burger from Oh Boy and take it for a dance. Trouble was that this burger couldn't even two step and basically had two left feet. I arrived at Oh Boy literally on the nose of noon hoping to beat the lunch rush and ordered up an Oh Little Boy Combo with sweet potato fries. Most of the major complaints I've read about OB's is that they seem to overcook the burgers so I figured if I ordered up the baby burgers and being smaller, they'd spend less time on the grill. Makes sense, right? Ummmmm....apparently not. It took almost 25 minutes before my order finally surfaced. 

So out the door I dash with my lunch bag in hand only to discover ten minutes later that they eff'ed up my order. Wrong kind of cheese on those little sliders. No sweet potato fries but rather regular french fries which were soggy and cold by the time I got to them. As for those little 2 ounce burgers.... well they were pretty much small pieces of carbon on a bun. Did I order blackened burgers? They were dry and crusty and no amount of toppings was going to save these little charred nuggets. 

Someone needs to smack those grill boys with a hot spatula because when you eff up Momma's burger she is gonna be pissed big time. For this shitty bag of baby burgers I forked out $13 bucks. I felt like I'd been hosed. 

The restaurant itself is really cool. It's large and unlike Craft that can seat only about 8 people, the Oh Boy seats about 100 people. I love the bar area and I'm hopeful that eating in the restaurant would yield a much more favorable result. I've still got my discount coupons from the very first time I wandered in and the grill was out of commission. If anyone is interested in using them, let me know, I'm not so sure I'm ready to go back to Oh Boy just yet. 

Afterwards I thought to myself that I should have walked a little further east and gone in to the Leslieville Cheese Store and gotten a grilled cheese for lunch. I would have been a whole lot happier.",4,2,1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw,review,8

I guess the bottom line is that their burgers are no good.... they're not horrible, but they're not good either. 
I ordered a Spicy Boy Combo and despite the burger being clearly cooked to a nice medium inside, it was very dry and black on the outside. Second, the meat lacked any distinctive beefy flavour and was very bland - it was almost like eating frozen patty. I think it's simply due to an inefficient kitchen that doesn't know proper food handling. They also need a better ordering system where burgers and fries are served within 10-15mins. Why should take 30-45 mins to be served? The owners need to make changes otherwise they'll be expecting to close down very soon.",1,2,1qUzvlZLyT_ELWnIokUTJw,review,1

This Subway has a group of employees that wish you would implode in the parking lot before you make it to their door. I'm not expecting someone to hold the door for me, welcome me to the establishment, and take my coat, but do you people really have to be such a bunch of frowny muthas? 

I can't crack a joke, utter a friendly word, or either breathe in the same space as these employees without getting the look of death from any one of them, especially the older guy with grayish hair.

We started off by having the bruschetta. Their bruschetta is piled high on each piece of bread they give you. You can really taste the fresh ingredients, but for some reason it all seems to fail to come together in the end. There is something missing. This ended up being a theme of our meals there. My girlfriend had a pizza with pesto and grilled chicken pieces. The chicken could have been spread out a little more throughout the pizza, but this could be the way they do it in Italy so I can't judge. This dish also seem to struggle to bring everything together.bThe dish I had was a creamy pasta with goat cheese and walnuts. I actually really enjoyed this dish but somehow think it needed just a little more kick.

Being on the tourist trap of a street that is crescent, I wasn't expecting cheap prices. Many of their dishes are more on the expensive side but considering some of the ingredients and the nice location it is pretty justifiable.

What I liked: Restaurant is pretty roomy. The resto has an upper floor for bigger parties. The view gives on to Crescent and de Maisoneuve. The portions were reasonable. The price was too. I had the chicken al palio which was decent. I suggest ordering pasta, because theres a large selection and it comes with a decent amount of protein or vegetables. The crowd seems reletively young (early and late 20s), especially when I was there. The drinks are averagely sized, I didnt check the price though. 

What I didn't like: My friend who was the birthday girl had made a reservation for the correct amount of people, but when she arrived places were missing. We were stuck reorganizing the seating our selves. I feel they really work hard to give a true italian feel by allowing a 45 minute delay between serving everyone else and then serving me. The music wasn't appropriate at all, a mix of rap with some asian sounding stuff. Given that it was the coldest day of the year, most of us froze upstairs waiting to get our plates and then waiting to pay.

I'm not expecting a lot when it's a situation like this, but this restaurant was not able to live up to my already lowered expectation. 

Food:
The server brought us two baskets of complimentary bread with a dish of olive oil and vinegar . The bread looks decent, they look like some homemade croissants. But, the texture was awful!  None of us can take a second bite of it, it's so dry! It taste like it's either a few days old or it has been microwaved multiple times! Also, the olive oil to share? what is this? Are they expecting everyone to dip in that plate? It's so gross....and inconvenient. Its okay to share butter or other spread, but I've never shared olive oil before.
We ordered an Italian sausage pizza as appetizers to share, it was average, the crust was too thick...nothing special.
Main course, I ordered a veggie primervera, which is just vegetarian pasta with tomato sauce.  It did not satisfy me either, overall very blend and in terms of vegetables, I was expecting some portebello mushroom, big slice of eggplants and cucumber, cherry tomato.... but instead, it's all thinly sliced, you almost can't see them in your pasta, and just regular mushroom that were shrunk after cooking. The tomato sauce was also too glue-y.....
Dessert - I shared a Tiramisu with a friend, it's the type that comes in a cup with lady fingers at the bottom of the cup. This was like one of the worst tiramisu you can get at a restaurant. It tastes like store bought, and made one week ago. The cheese on the top are already becoming chewy and jello like! We only had half

The food are so terrible, when the server came and ask how were the  food, I actually said it tastes bad (because he saw our unfinished tiramisu) and I think he was offended.

Service:
He forgot to bring the spoon for people who ordered pasta. SO this is what happened, I asked for a spoon as soon as he puts down my plate of pasta, and it took him like 5mins to come back because he went off and took care of other tables and he forgot... when he came back, he only brought 1 spoon for me, not for my other friends who were also having pasta. (well, you'd expect him to bring enough for everyone who's having pasta, that's a standard utensils to eat pasta , especially it's an Italian restaurant, how do you not know that) ...Later, my friends that are sitting at the other end of the table had to ask him again for spoon...

Their menu is standard, but changes everytime I come. Agree with Lauren W. about the Gnocchi. This was the first time I tried it and I love it! Everything here is very good, except once I got the Gorganzola + Endive salad and I wasn't pleased - but not the fault of the restaurant, I think Endive is an acquired taste. 

The food is mainly Italian. It's on the busy street of Crescent, and one of the less touristy spots. They have 2 levels, a more loungey one at the bottom, and more restaurant on the top. They also have a nice balcony out there, and perfect for people watching. Same for the downstairs as it's walled with large glass windows.

There was no pride or integrity in the way it was put together.  I don't know how to describe the taste exactly, but I clearly remember that it didn't taste natural or right.

Duck confit- score. I think there was deep fried apple in there.  Steak - beautiful cut and perfectly cooked but I have to admit I dont like my steak covered in sauce but I think that was my mistake. The fennel salad had too much of a similar creamy texture. Fried oysters were lost. Daughter had trout and which was excellent and beautifully paired with watermelon radish.

We came from Parts & Labour next door, where the service was terrible but at least they had Summerlicious to use as a poor excuse. Can't say the same for Geraldine, where we were greeted by a permanent air of I-hate-our-customers.

As our server brought the first drink (and first bill) to our table, she informed us that it was ""cash and carry"" because it was ""late"". We were like, ""Huh?"" It wasn't even busy and the bar wasn't closing. She said we'd have to pay for each drink as we went. I've never been to a sit-down place with $18+tax drinks that had a bill accompany every glass, but it's certainly a good way to leave a sour taste in people's mouths before they've even tasted the Sazerac.

We'd barely taken our first sips when the server came back, pointedly* tapped on the cheque she'd just brought my friend and said something like, ""Your bill's right here."" Yeah, we know! You told us five seconds ago. Holy tacky.

Before we left, another friend with more cojones than yours truly spoke to our server to politely question the automatic 20% gratuity** based on the level (read: low) of service she received. Even after some back and forth, in an amazing demonstration of the very lack of customer service skills being called out, the server refused to reissue the bill. Seriously? Is the auto-tip on groups here a free pass to be awful? Another girl accidentally double-tipped because of this, too.

I'm not sure what the folks at Geraldine found to dislike about making quick money on a chilled-out group downing pricy drinks for maybe an hour. The styling is fancy but the vibe was so not. Maybe it was just this one server, but I won't be back to find out. Cheers!

*Speaking of ""pointedly"", the bartender scooped up a loose flower petal on the side of my glass with his finger and plopped it right back in, giving my cocktail what NSYNC would refer to as a ""digital digital getdown"". I'm no flower myself, so I didn't mind, but a germaphobe might shudder.

w3eiFFpo-S7gcHwj4P5YeQ,PUD4p2NZUchenw7QeOYhIw,2014-10-24,0,"Ate there last night we were a party of 7, while it did take us some time to go through the wine list, we had a hard time finding something suitable for everyone, luckily the second bottle we ordered was pretty good but also expensive at 80 for a bottle of local wine from Norman Hardie, I will say though the waiter was very good in explaining the wines. Food service took some time and while we initially ordered oysters it took easily 30 minutes to get them out. We had a variety of sides but had to ask for more and at $6 for a plate of olives it's a bit pricey. The Cauliflower was pretty good but very salty, the shrimp and grits were excellent. In terms of mains I had the quail which was served on a piece of toast with a corn type salad, it was not hearty at all and very boney, a little pricey for the amount of food served up. My wife had a steak as did a few others at the table, no one was really raving about it, I tried it and felt it was very buttery. The others had the seafood broth or whatever fancy french word they used, I tried it and it was very good, that was the winner at the table. Dessert unfortunately there was only one choice and no one went for it, i thought that was a bit sad to not offer more towards the end. Overall our bill came to just under 600 with tip, I feel that when there is a big party a restaurant should not bring down their service, nobody came to ask us how are food was, no one asked us if they can get us anything else, our wine glasses were touched up on once and there was no explanation of any food that was coming out of the kitchen except for the oysters. I thought that area was lacking. Nice atmosphere and we are lucky we had good company, but overall this place is average as many places in Toronto and will have to get a little better in certain areas.

KRg49TDyrYmS4WIe3Ak6tQ,HS7WW9oFGTdJfC90kCHpkg,2014-11-10,1,"On a desolate Sunday night, Marie and I wandered off the streets into this undiscovered restaurant (at least to us) like some sort of lucid vagabonds.  

We heard that our good friend Alex (former chef of Farmhouse) was back in town and had recently taken the reigns of this Parkdale restaurant.. not to mention that Geraldine was on our ""places to go"" list for quite some time anyway... So it seemed like the perfect time to go. 

As soon as we walked in, we fell into a time-warp and instantly we were transported to the 1920s during prohibition. The vibe was cool and calm, the staff was warm and friendly. 

First, the drinks.... Marie had warned me about the prices of the drinks and I couldn't understand why they charged so much for cocktails.  Needless to say, I ate my words in the form of a beverage.  Easily the best cocktails in the city, no contest. 

Michael is a wizard behind the bar, constructing his elixirs right in the open for on-lookers to see.  I was thrilled to see REAL Absinthe on the cocktail menu, but I was even more excited when I saw how he prepared it and presented it.  I am not going to spoil it for you, you just have to see for yourself... Amazing. 

Our server Brendan offered up some oysters from East Coast to West Coast.  This guy knew his shit and you could tell he took pride in his work.  He took care of us for the evening, we never felt rushed and it was completely relaxing.... or perhaps that was the Absinthe talking?

For me, Chef Molitz' challenge was going to be finding his stride within the French realm of cooking and technique.  This is a stark contrast to the rustic Modern-Canadian style that we are all use to from Alex.  So this dinner was going to be interesting, at least from the point of view of a French food geek like myself. 

There is a reason why Alex is revered as one of Toronto's best; his ability to serve up consistent, rich flavours that are on point and familiar to the senses.  The Duck Croquette reminded me of childhood dinners of mash potatoes and turkey at Thanksgiving.  And the Duck Confit was crispy and salty just as it should be, served with bean cassoulet that was smokey and creamy.   Delicious. 

If I had to order one thing on the menu, (aside from the Absinthe of course) it would be the Vietnamese Coffee and Chocolate Chip cookies.  It simply hits all the right areas.

As Vijaya notes in her review, the donuts are yeast variety, which I don't usually like because of their consistency (I usually prefer the denser cake-donut variety). But here they do something to give the very light donut a bit of a crunch. I put it down to ""magic"".  Vijaya also notes that the Boston creme filling is spread, not injected - I see this as preferable to a big glob in one quarter of the donut, because you get creme in every bite.  To each their own, I guess. 

On my visits this summer, I was overjoyed to see BUTTER TARTS. I'd asked in prior years if they ever made them, and was told ""only around Christmas"", but by popular request they had them, and on special for $4.50 for 6!  These are not huge tarts, but they are excellent, and for comparable quality they would be twice the price at ""The Flaky Tart"" and other winning tart makers.

For one, it's a neighborhood joint, family run. Also, the thought of local fresh baked goods was alluring, as I am a fiend for carbs. And, it's only a 10 minute drive from where I live, so total score right?

Well, here are my thoughts. I headed out this morning around 11 am to grab a doughnut or two. Prime time for baked goods, I would hope. They had quite the variety: Chocolate Dip, Vanilla Dip, Sugar, Cinnamon/Sugar Twist, etc. All were yeast based I thought, or at least not cake doughnut-like.

I chose the Boston Cream, and Dutchie. They both had crumbly textures and were on the drier side. Disappointing :(

I had anticipated the fluffy, chewy texture associated with a yeast doughnut, and was totally let down. May be they use baking powder/soda here instead? I don't know.
Moreover, the vanilla pudding/custard/cream in the Boston Cream was spread sparingly. No squishy, gooey goodness here.

NEVER in my life did I think it would take me over 30 minutes to first place my order with one of the most incompetent cashiers I have ever seen in my 16 years of being in the service industry myself. I had to say 3 times to her alone what type of coffee I wanted, along with another 3 times to tell her I wanted it with ice. She then handed me the smallest hot coffee I have ever seen. She then, with an attitude the ENTIRE time, got a manager to come and help her. She then made me a coffee after I had to tell her twice as well what I wanted. She hands me two of the smallest ice coffees I have ever seen. I asked the cashier with an attitude if it was actually a medium because I am in shock as to how small it is. She grabs it out of my hand and holds the cup up while pointing to a small M on the side of it. I tasted both of the shit coffees they gave me. One tasted like chocolate milk and the other one tasted like straight espresso. What I ordered was two iced French Vanilla lattes, add mocha and add an extra turbo shot. I literally order this from a couple different McDonald's and know it's something they make. So. I then ask the bitch cashier to see a manager because at this point I'm just furious. She informs me the lady that made my coffees was my manager but her gm was also there. So I asked to speak to him. She stands there just yelling his name. I literally laughed to myself. The gm comes out from the back. He happens to be the man who I heard at the counter a few minutes before then telling the staff and pretty much anybody in there how he had to deal with another store being robbed of 487 dollars. Like. I'm an assistant gm. I have been a gm. You do NOT come in and act like that as a gm. I ask him if he can remake my coffee because they are not correct and taste like shit. I tell him what I want and he basically was telling me in a nut shell what I order at least 3 times a week, isn't possible. He luckily made me the coffees I asked for. And again with more attitude hands me my tiny ass little coffee. Then as I try to say thank you, he just pretends I'm not standing there and keeps commanding his lazy incompetent staff on where trash cans should be. Like come the fuck on Robert M. I think you paying attention to customer service, food times and what you're actual job entails rather than standing there bitching like a high school child. Literally no sooner did I turn around, another lady had come inside complaining about how she had been waiting 20 minutes for a caramel frappe. Somebody higher up needs to handle this store and teach their employees to have manners as well as know what they are supposed to be doing. It's common sense on how you treat people in restaurants, fast food or not. I will literally NEVER step foot into that place again and by the end of the day will be calling district managers and whoever else I can. I would recommend waiting at Dunkin Doughnuts where it would at least have been well worth the wait.

When I told my friends where I was going for dinner, I was met with furrowed brows of confusion.  ""Dane? Like the Great Dane?""  Admittedly, I was not familiar with the city or its citizens either, but I had heard great things about this little bar called Tootsie's and their inventive, and at times risky cuisine.  I found out quickly that  this little hometown gem was worth the back-country trek. 

 From the outside, this place looks like your standard dive bar, and honestly, it's appearance on the inside does too.  There are several tables set up for dining and a singular pool table lurking in the corner.  All of these things are fairly standard,  but what makes Tootsie's special is the proprietor, employees, and patrons.  We were there on a weekday night and the place was just banging.  Each person sitting at the bar was friendly and inviting.  Drinks were flowing and the party was on.  The owner was walking around and talking to everyone and the bartender and chef were equally amiable.  

What was even more impressive was the food.  Tootsie's surprisingly houses a full kitchen in the back of the bar, making it possible to provide high end daily specials to patrons. The night we were there the special was  roasted quail and smoked pork belly.  We had the choice of picking either of the options or a combination of both. My dining partner and I opted for one of each.  Usually I'm very critical of the way restaurants cook each of these proteins.  Pork belly is one of those foods, along with duck breast, that is ruined for me without proper rendering.  At Tootsie's it was cooked perfectly, and was served in a large meaty portion. Yum.  The quail was cooked to perfection, boasting moist morsels of meat.  

Wait....hold on...I forgot one major thing: the ranch.  

Some people (my husband included) look down on me for my love of ranch dressing, but I stand proud with my obsession.  I will eat anything dipped in this herbed mayonnaise sauce.  The chef at Tootsie's brought me out TWO different kinds of ranch to use on my salad and side dishes, and I was in heaven.  For me, the ranch alone is worth the trip. 

Overall, go to Tootsie's with your expectations in check.  This small bar will most likely win you over the same way it wooed me.  It was a fun trip out to the country for this city girl, and I plan on making it many many more times.",0,5,29uk0fZJAWdSQhWhasYI9A,review,0

Secondly the guy playing the accordion went to every table asking people to give him a tip. For me and my partner this was a really awkward interruption. 

Thirdly, the owner asked me the exact same thing as the first time I went ""are you chinese? I love chinese people, my son's best friend is chinese"".

ahNb01_S8mPuRq3PNb7Cog,WjVUkCnH3KA37BjPJ0e0Yw,2011-09-09,0,"Wenn ich gleich eingangs zugebe, da  ich Hotelrestaurants eigentlich nicht mag (zuviele Erinnerungen an Seminare mit gef llter H hnchenbrust mit Broccoli aus der Kategorie ""chicken or pasta?"" und trostlose Abendessen auf Reisen), dann mu  ich mir nat rlich die Frage gefallen lassen, was mich ins Restaurant Weissenhof im Arcotel Camino treibt. Tja, was soll ich sagen - auf Stuttgarts architektonischer Gruselmeile namens Heilbronner Stra e fiel mir irgendwann das Altbauensemble positiv auf, und das Design des Eingangs wirkte ansprechend. Und es waren auch nirgends verwertbare Kritiken zu finden... Und so fanden wir uns heute im Weissenhof wieder, nachdem der Tafelberg keinen Platz f r uns hatte.
 
Bei der telefonischen Reservierung bat ich um einen sch nen Tisch und wurde gleich gefragt, ob es ein besonderer Anla  sei - meine Antwort war nein, wir h tten nur gerne was am Fenster oder am Rand und nicht direkt im Get mmel. Wurde vermerkt und auch erf llt, w re angesichts der sehr  bersichtlichen Besetzung an einem Freitagabend nicht wirklich n tig gewesen.
 
Der Eingang zum Restaurant ist identisch mit Hotel und Bar, man steigt au en die Stufen hoch und wird hinter den T ren gleich von einem riesigen Kronleuchter begr  t, der - zumindest heute abend - pink angestrahlt war. Hinter dem Kronleuchter ging eine Innentreppe gleich weiter in den Hotelbereich, rechts und links von dieser landete man an der Bar mit ledergepolsterten B nken und dunkelbraunen Tischen zu beiden Seiten, rechts biegt man ins Restaurant ab. Die Farbstellung ist creme-braun, laut Karte zitiert man -  berraschung - die Weissenhofsiedlung, deshalb auch der eher gew hnungsbed rftige braun-beige gemusterte Teppich im Restaurant, das farblich ebenfalls in cremefarbenen Leder und dunklem Holz gehalten war. Ja, und da geht's schon los, warum haben Hotelrestaurants immer Teppichboden? Und gruselige abgeh ngte Decken? Und eine Beleuchtung, wie sie kein normales Restaurant installieren w rde? Fragen  ber Fragen, unfair, weil ja, wir sind im Hotel.
 
Der bei weitem angenehmste Teil des Hotel-Seins war der Service. Der war umwerfend, freundlich, souver n, unaufdringlich, eine gelungene Interaktion mit dem Gast, weder servil noch desinteressiert. K nnte ich daf r sechs Sterne geben, jederzeit sofort. Also ganz, ganz gro es Kompliment! Und wirklich sch ne  berraschung war die Aperitiv-Empfehlung Trollinger brut, ein au erordentlicher Schaumwein, der mit meinem Trollinger-Alptraum von der IHK absolut nichts gemeinsam hat. Mit   5,90 f r 0,1 l aber auch sehr anspruchsvoll in der Preislage. Brot kam z gig, nicht schlecht, aber es fehlte an Knusprigkeit. Die Butter dazu war eiskalt, keine ideale Kombination. Verwunderlicherweise kein Gru  aus der K che, h tte ich bei einem Restaurant mit diesem Anspruch eigentlich erwartet.
 
Die Karte ist eher klein, man wirbt mit Schw bisch /  sterreichisch ( sterreichisch das Men , die Fleischgerichte und ein paar Nachspeisen), zwischendurch einige Einsprengsel nicht ganz eindeutiger Provenienz zwischen Crossover und B ffelmozzarella. Eine Handvoll Vorspeisen (Carpaccio von der Maultasche, Beef Tartar), zwei Suppen, dreimal Fisch (ged mpfter Viktoriabarsch, Zander mit Paprikapolenta), zweimal Vegetarisch (Erd pfel-Schwammerl-Gulasch, Topfen/Kraut), vier oder f nf Fleischgerichte (Tafelspitz, Kalbsrahmgulasch), ebensoviele Desserts.
Wirklich sehr gute Weinauswahl mit Schwerpunkt Ba-W  und  , ungew hnlich, exzellent und - pardon - schweineteuer. 1/8 Wei  vom exklusiveren Teil der Karte war bei   6,20 bis 7,90, zugegeben, die Weine waren au ergew hnlich mit Empfehlung auf den Weing tern Currle und Hager (die g nstigeren fingen bei    2,90 das Achtel an, aber wir waren probierw tig), aber bei   6,60 f r 0,75 l V sslauer Mineralwasser medium w rde ich mich sehr gerne mal mit dem Controller unterhalten.
 
Mein Mann nahm das  sterreichische Men  mit schw bischem Einschlag, erst Fl dlesuppe (nein, nicht Frittatensuppe, Frittaten seien knuspriger als Fl dle, hie  es), dann Wiener Schnitzel mit Kartoffelsalat, etwas Feldsalat und Prei elbeeren, zum Schlu  Kaiserschmarrn mit Zwetschgenkompott und Apfelmus. Ich war konzeptlos und nahm den Papayasalat mit Thunfisch (drei W rfel Thunfisch, einmal mit Petersilie, einmal kro  natur, einmal mit Leinsamen, alle drei innen noch roh, tolle Qualit t), das Dressing sehr neutral bis geschmacksarm, einzig belebt von ein paar Bl ttchen Thai-Basilikum. Die gute Produktqualit t lie  die fehlende Originalit t verzeihen. Fl dlesuppe war eher auf der salzigen Seite und laut meiner besseren H lfte nichts besonderes.
 
Danach die organisatorische Herausforderung, ich hatte die Kukuruzsuppe und anschlie end den ganzen Saibling mit Petersilienkartoffeln bestellt, mein Mann eben Hauptgang und Dessert, die salomonische L sung war, mir die Suppe separat zu bringen, fand ich auch besser als wenn der Saiblingduft zum Kaiserschmarrn r berzieht.

Anschlie end hatte ich Teigtaschen mit Steinpilzf llung (15 Euro), f r die dasselbe gilt: Ich habe absolut keinen Pilz, schon gar keinen Steinpilz herausschmecken k nnen. Da sie schmeckten wie in einer schlechten Kantine, fragte ich die Bedienung, ob diese Pasta im eigenen Haus angefertigt worden sei. Sie sagte ganz schnell ""Ja"" und verschwand sofort wieder. Wobei ich sagen muss, dass die Bedienung mit ihrer Freundlichkeit und ihrer Aufmerksamkeit der einzige Glanzpunkt in diesem Restaurant war. Meine Begleitung hatte einen schw bischen Rostbraten (19 Euro). das Fleisch war gut. Die Sp tzle waren sehr dick und schwammen in einer total  berfetteten So e. 
Danach gab es als Dessert noch ein Bananensorbet. Zwei dicke graue Scheiben mit einem sehr kristallinen Eis, gut waren nur die Spuren der Schokoladenso e daneben. Last but not least: 
Die Toiletten waren sehr sauber und angenehm.

Das Restaurant empf ngt in einem modernen, modischen aber dennoch attraktiven, wenn auch etwas k hlem Ambiente. Die Begr  ung war freundlich, professionell und effizient. Das Restaurant empfiehlt sich selbst als Restaurant einer  sterreichisch-schw bischen K che und so fiel die Wahl f r den Test auf das Wiener Schnitzel, das auf der Speisekarte als ""Wiener Schnitzel vom Stauffenberg-Kalb mit Erd pferl-Vogerlsalat"" pr sentiert wird und nach eigener Wahl durch ein Glas Gr nen Veltliner Federspiel begleitet werden sollte. Nun, ein Glas des Weines reichte zur Begleitung nicht, da zwischen Bestellung und Servieren des Schnitzels rund 90 Minuten vergingen. Die viel zu lange Wartezeit wurde durch zwei kleine Scheibchen Wei brot  berbr ckt, was sehr schwer fiel. Das Schnitzel selbst war eher ein Schnitzelchen und entsprach nicht ganz den Erwartungen an ein wirklich gutes Wiener Schnitzel. Und auch der Erd pferl-Vogerlsalat war ok, aber nicht wirklich sehr gut, alles zum Preis von rund 22 Euro. Das von der Begr  ung bekannte Servicepersonal war mittlerweile auch schon verschwunden und man hatte auch nach dem Servieren den Eindruck, ""vergessen"" worden zu sein. 

Fazit: Wenn man im Hotel  bernachtet und den Fu weg in die Innenstadt scheut, kann man bei nicht zu hoch gesteckten Erwartungen, das Restaurant besuchen. In umgekehrter Richtung lohnt sich nach unserer Einsch tzung der Weg jedoch nicht!",0,3,5sphAhVL85z6QW4dCjwCUg,review,0

I went to Sam's Cafe last night with two of my girlfriends and based on my previous experience at the downtown location, I figured we'd get a pretty decent meal.  Not the case!

Carter, our server, was awful.  I hate to be so hard on him but as soon as he took our drink order and we didn't order any alcoholic beverages, he went downhill from there.  My friend Allyson ordered the rotisserie chicken special and I ordered the applewood smoked pecan salmon.  DeDe had a few question before she decided and Carter not only had no clear answers for her, he didn't bother to try to get the answers.  Unacceptable!  (Just to clarify, these were basic questions such as 'what kind of vegetables come on the fire grilled vegetable tacos?' and 'What is the marinade for the chicken fajitas?')  

The next thing we know, we are given their special chips and salsa... I love how they combine sweet and salty in a colorful arrangement!  Those were delicious.  However, it was a good ten minutes until we saw our water and when you are eating salty chips and salsa, it's nice to have something to wash it down with!  Minus star #2.

So, our food comes and DeDe's fajitas are totally different than what Carter explained.  She isn't bitchy about sending them back but kindly asks for just the chicken and vegetables on a plate since that is what she was expecting.  This is where the 3rd missing star comes in - I am not kidding when I tell you that DeDe did not get her food until after both Allyson and I were done eating ours (and we were eating really slow)!  It was not right... and Carter was not very apologetic.  He came over to offer us a free dessert but being that we are all in healthy eating mode, we declined.  They did take the fajitas off the bill in the end, but it was expected at this point.

First of all, the chips and salsa ROCK.  The chips are freshly made, and the salsa is this chunky, chipotle-infused bowl of heaven.

I got the fish tacos -- they were fantastic.  A filet of blackened tilapia, slaw mix, pico, and this chipotle sauce.  Would absolutely recommend this to anybody that likes fish tacos -- sooooo good!

Kelly got the carnitas platter and my sister got the chopped salad.  I didn't try either of their dinner, but they both enjoyed theirs.

It's one of those places that's relatively convenient, has decent parking, and can handle larger crowds since they don't ever seem to be even remotely busy.

I will agree that when I have been there with small, personal groups, service has been unbearably slow. They would definitely earn one more star if there were even a whiff of concern... but when the group is larger, we have always received exemplary service - dare I say size does matter?

The food is actually above standard, for its kind. I love the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast (it has lots of goat cheese inside and is covered in their red pepper cream sauce - which honestly I think would be good spread over an old leather sneaker). I could eat the Adovo Chicken Pasta twice a week and never get tired of it (same reference to red pepper cream sauce). My ex swore that the Meatloaf was the best (but really, what can't be improved by a generous portion of bacon?!!). And my all time favorite has to be Chile Rubbed Sirloin - it's flavorful, without being overpowering, always cooked exactly as requested, and generally requires the threat of forking when others realize that ""it looks better than mine.""

If you like Margaritas. You should be happy with what Sam's has to offer. The Orange Beso makes my toes tingle. Fortunately, they limit those to two servings - otherwise I might find myself behaving badly. They have several ""house margaritas"" all of which I've enjoyed (really it's not my fault, I work with a lot of social alcoholics... it's the only way to deal with the stress).

My final offering is that this particular location (I haven't ever tried at the others, so they might be accommodating as well), is great for private functions. They will basically close down whatever portion of the restaurant you might need, either feed you buffet style or from the menu, work with you on drink coupons, let you hang corporate flair, etc.  If you are in a pinch for a business gathering in a relaxed environment give it a try.",2,3,0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA,review,3

The waitress was very attentive and dropped by many times to make sure we were fine. The chips and salsa were amazing! I saw some Yelp reviews on my phone that talked about the chips. I thought really? They are chips! Can they really be that exciting? Damn skippy! In fact, most of the time I didn't even put them in salsa-  they were so good just by themselves. 

My friend ordered the Red Rock Meatloaf served with peppers, bacon and onions, mashed potatoes and she swapped spinach in place of the corn on the cob. I went with the Applewood Smoked Pecan Salmon. Damn! It was salmon with pecans, there was a side spinach and the salmon was served on a bed of mashed sweet potatoes and a red papaya and serrano chile sauce. I detected something else that seemed like slightly spicy apple sauce, but I don't know what it was.

QCFPAq0-D9ZGX0GyS9862w,SrF972IxsELYQ3eaWB5X4A,2009-04-30,10,"Saturday is Happy Hour day at Sam's Caf . 
Happy because we hadn't been there in a while and happy because Sam's has improved since the last time we were there:)
I say ""judge slowly"" and ""give people a second chance"" and ""a stitch in time, saves nine"" and all kinds of other inappropriate adages...but my point is that sometimes a second chance is in order.
Sam's Caf  had been in the rotation for a few years and then we had a couple of poor experiences there, and just didn't go back...you know how it is...there's a lot of competition for the dining dollar (it used to be ""dollars"" but the recession/depression has hit everyone!).
But, this isn't about then...it's about now, so let's get up to date, shall we?
The Beautiful Carin and I headed for the club last Saturday to sweat off the weeks caloric build up and sweat it off we did! (you know, I think I sweat so much because I come from ice age survivor stock and here I am trying to live in the desert!).
Anyway, after we finished our extremely grueling, yet fulfilling programs of physical exercise, got ourselves all cleaned up, (lookin' good and smellin' sweet) we were talking between ourselves (as married people often do) and trying to figure how to reward ourselves for the excellent workouts we had just finished.
How about a nice big lunch?
Sam's Caf  has Happy Hours on Saturday's and Sunday's that run from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm. 
Well, that's just inspired!
We tottered in and sat at the bar (I think that's going to be a defining happy hour ""move"" for us), and the barman greeted us with a warmth and enthusiasm normally reserved for long lost play cousins...a good start:)
We looked at the happy hour menu and they have some nice selections for really good prices.
We ordered roast pork sliders with a chipotle barbecue sauce, Carin's  ""go-to"" selection...grilled chicken nacho's and Sedona Spring Rolls (also served with the chipotle barbecue sauce and pico de gallo).
While were waiting for the food to arrive, Sam's minions brought us more food...chips and salsa. 
Now, I don't want anyone to think Sam's is mexcian food...it's not. The whole place is more ""southwest inspired"" as opposed to ""southwest"", or ""Mexican"" or ""authentic"". 
They have d cor that looks sort of Fredrick Remington meets Javier Sordo Madaleno...nice, southwest-ish/modern. The chairs in the dining room are, frankly, less than comfortable but they fit the d cor, so, OK. Just don't complain to me when they make your butt sore after 20 minutes!
Back to the chips and salsa...I like the flour tortilla chips that Sam's serves, as well as the blue corn and sweet potato chips and the salsa is decent as well...very tomatoey, but spicy and flavorful, but it's not Mexican...not for everybody, but we were happy:)
The actual food portion of our lunch came before we became completely engorged with the chips portion. Everything was very tasty. 
The pork roast sliders were truly delightful...moist, seasoned perfectly on soft warm rolls:) (BTW, I'm reasonably certain that you can't get swine flu from eating pork roast, but I will say that the roast pork sliders ""flew"" off the plate:) . The Sedona Spring Rolls have plenty of spice and heat, and are also very nice.
All in all, a very solid Happy Hour offering for $18 and change (before tip).
Go, sit at the bar (always better service and your butt will thank me), and enjoy Sam's Happy Hour!",8,3,0HwrX6P6lh92F0f-A_QzjA,review,6

I've done dinner and drinks a few times before, but most recently had happy hour stuff at the bar - with reasonably priced margaritas, and friendly bartenders too.  Decent, but so-so chicken tortilla soup and quesadillas.

Jake is right.  This can be a pretty good date place, when you go with a pretty good date.  My last dinner here was an awful date gone awry, but thankfully the food was the saving grace here (or maybe it was by default).  Let's just say that my date almost got a swift kick in the ass on the way out and my delicious chile-rubbed steak almost got thrown as a weapon Napoleon Dynamite style.  But I digress, back to the dinner.  The steak was cooked as I asked (medium), and had a great marinade with a flavorful spiced rub, but the chile mashed potatoes were OK, and thought it lacked that chile punch that I was hoping for.

We went as a group of about twelve guests for a business lunch today. A few of us ordered the catch of the day, which was the red snapper. However, it was so flavourless and tough that it tasted like the catch of yesterday. The parsnips that came with it were tasty though. Two people ordered the hanger steak, which presented beautifully and looked delicious, but they both said their meat was cold. 
Some of the waitstaff were nice, one seemed very inexperienced and a couple of others seemed snooty and apathetic. One served my salad in front of me, then without asking if  I'd ordered it, took it away and gave it to someone else. I even stopped him to ask him why he was doing that, yet he ignored me and continued on serving it to the other individual.

We are Saturday and It's Montreal en Lumiere. There's a special Brunch Menu for the occasion. My friend Karine heard good things about La Coupole so we decide to give it a try. We make a reservation for 3.

I arrive 10 minutes late, my friends are already at our table. The first floor is completely empty and its 12:40. There around 14  people (approx 5 tables) in the second floor. Our server give us the menu and coffee. 

We get our appetizer after 25 Min. Its a bit long for smoke salmon and oysters.
My oysters are not very cold and only get a piece of lemon and a sour sauce as garnish. Nobody is impress with their plates.

We wait another 40 Min to get our second dish. We all ordered egg Benedict and they are all overcooked. So basically not really an egg Benedict. There's a table spoon of hollandaise sauce and the plate is really sad looking. Finally after more than an hour of service we finally get our first glass of water and toast. If you compared it with eggspectation, im telling you, eggspectation is just Wayyy better and you won't feel rip off.

At this point I don't even want to complain. We had 2 different server and now the manager is serving us. Its really strange because overall we had 4 different server (3 server and 1 manager) doing the service.
The manager took a while before finally taking out finished plates. He made and inappropriate comment to my friend about her not finishing her potatoes that made everybody uncomfortable. 

My friend told me then that when she arrive 15 min early for brunch the manager told her really seriously to wait outside. when she was about to turn around and leave he told her that it was a joke... so you can have a good picture of the brilliant type of manager running that place. 

Finally for our last dish, my friend who is a pastry chef got pastries of course. The cake was sooo dry just trying to take a bite was work. our plates once again looked all very sad. the waiters were all trying hard too look very busy with their now 4 tables. 

We were the 3 of us debating and thinking hard to realize it was all our worst service we ever had. on top of it we all make better food than what we had serve. It was not quality food and we all paid 40$ for that.

the salmon/egg/rice scramble was FANTASTIC. came with a side of spinach with this delicious dressing that we both devoured.  it totally hit the spot and was just the right temperature (i have a problem with things either being too hot or too hold when they're served).  i wish this was a regular item on their menu because i'd be in here every day.  the blueberry pancakes were wheat i think, which made them not as moist as regular pancakes, but the blueberries inside of them provide the perfect amount of juiciness.  Honey syrup was different but what really made the pancakes was the whipped cream.  My girlfriend commented on how it was ""just like her grandma made it"".  Always a good sign :)

I arrived just past noon with a co worker, luckily there was a police car parked nearby so I was not afraid to leave my car in this less than ideal neighborhood.

 From the outside it looks modern, trendy and bright. 

Inside are white tables and chairs, seating is limited but their business also seemed to be a bit limited. After hearing about the specials and looking over the menu I chose the Blue Cheese Quesadilla with tomato Marmalade as I do love blue cheese. 

When my meal arrived I was shocked how small, pale and pedestrian it looked. Unlike the photo provided my quesadilla was much smaller made with an out of a package soft taco sized tortilla. Accompanying it was a small almost garnish sized dollop of rice salad on top of some baby spinach greens. The rice salad was cold, and flavorless, cold rice is rarely a good culinary choice.

 My quesadilla was under done and unevenly browned, there was plenty of marmalade but not too much cheese. The flavors just did not work for me even when I tried to pair it with the apple garnish. 

My coworker ordered the lentil soup special of the day. It came in a small cup with a challa spinach and cheese Panini on the side. When a ~100lb female says hr portion was small you know it must be small. She enjoyed the soup, and felt the Panini was just mediocre filler. 

My second drink refill, when it finally came was warm as they had no ice in the pitcher.

(For shape, think of the Flatiron Building in New York on a tiny, tiny scale.)  The windows are covered with thin 15-foot mix-and-match drapes tied to reveal Grand and 13th Ave. views.  The vaguely triangular dining room gives way to a door frame through which you find the blackboard menu and register, where you order.

I took two friends on Saturday during Art Detour for a late lunch and the place was about half-full with the owner and one other person working.

There are two daily specials, and I had the Garbanzos and Eggplant in a Coconut Milk Curry, which came with brown rice, baguette pieces, and a side salad of field greens modestly but flavorfully dressed, all for $6.50.  The curry was rich, warm, and filling, and the firmness of the garbanzos went well with the butter-soft eggplant.  A great lunch for the price.

My friend Katie had the messy but delicious tabbouleh and chipotle hummus wrap, and my friend Kelly had a large salad with cranberries, almonds, goat cheese, and manchego.  It was dressed with balsamic vinegar only (no oil?), so the flavor was mostly sweet and tangy.

The drinks, we agreed, were on the subpar side.  The orangeade was inventive and attractive on the menu, but was mostly diluted and unsatisfying for $3.

Sapna's seems to be sorting out the ordering, serving, clean-up system, not to mention operating the register.  Ringing up sales took about 3-5 minutes per patron, and you pay at the end.  The half-eaten and abandoned sandwich at the adjacent table remained for our entire hour lunch.

The snarky worker gave me attitude when I asked how much longer it would be.

The red peppers in the quesadilla were actually in marmalade form and tasted fantastic - I'd love to try the bleu cheese and tomato quesadilla. I loved the simplicity of the panini; all of the veggies were cooked just right. The sandwich didn't fall apart, but it was fully stuffed with goodies. And if I could drink the Moroccan mint tea everyday, I'd consider myself the luckiest woman in the world.

The paninis are priced right - $7 for a nice sandwich with a small side salad of mixed greens. All-in-all, the food gets a solid 4 stars. The service, however, is their weak point.

I loved the building from the get go...had been there before and thought it was brilliant to open a restaurant in that space.  How cute!  Cozy and charming.  Loved it.  

We arrived at 2:30 on a Saturday and we were told to take a seat - and then we waited quite a while for someone to come and take our order.  They never asked us if we wanted water, and the drink I had ordered was not available so we both ordered cold drinks - he had Ginger Lemonaide and I had Orangeaide.  Loved the Ginger flavor, but both the drinks were syrup sweet - which was not what we were hoping for - we like our citrus to have some tang.
Then we ordered a bowl of soup, quesdilla with brie and onion marmalade (both for me) and a turkey sandwich with cheese and mustard sauce (him.)  Both our plates arrived and were very nice...but no soup ever came.  Then we waited, thinking the soup and the silverware was coming, and we waited...and waited...and no soup - and still waiting.  My lovely companion got up and stole some place settings from somewhere else and in doing so we snuck into the kitchen to inquire about my soup.  They said they forgot - which was cool - but apparently they had put it away and it was going to have to be reheated which meant we ended up sharing everything...except the soup.

Now for the food.....it was good - but not great.  It was somewhat bland.  It had great, fresh ingredients, but everything was tainted with something sweet.  The soup needed salt (they don't have any on the table) and the other items were meant to be sweeter - I guess.

So maybe this is a GREAT restaurant and I was just tainted by the slow service.  Or maybe we should have ordered something else.  I promise to go back - I refuse to give up on this place...It's just too damn cute!",0,3,-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg,review,0

First of all...service issues listed in prior reviews are mostly true. This is not a ""get 'em in, get 'em out"" kind of place, so we didn't see our waiter that often. I was prepared for a slow experience, so it didn't bother me...much. That said, I do want a cup of coffee more frequently than every 20 minutes. Our server mentioned that a fresh pot was being brewed, so I understood the delay for the first cup.

We both ordered brunch specials. I had the much bally-hooed pumpkin pancakes, which didn't taste all that pumpkin-y. I haven't yet decided if that is good or bad. The cream cheese/walnut topping was awesome and they were not skimpy with it. The pancakes were moist and delish. The leftovers (which didn't really fit into the chinese leftover box I was given) will be wonderful tomorrow a.m., I'm sure!

Hubby had a baked breakfast casserole. It smelled delish and he claims it was wonderful. It had spinach, chorizo, egg, tomato and cheese (and other stuff i'm sure) and was baked. It looked a bit runny, but after mixing it all together and slathering it on top of the home fries (which he claimed were good), it lost its runny appearance. Go figure!

I felt that the room could have used some sound deadening, as the group at the other table was a bit loud, but the front door was open and the street noise was non-existent. Cute atmosphere...all IKEA, all the time!

Been here twice. Second instance first Friday. Met with my precocious sister and a girl with a similar hair style. 

The waitress was charming and fresca like a cilantro roasted lime creme fraiche. As she explained the menu, she remarked on my visage and stated that I appeared unimpressed. Either I am easy to read or she is good at detecting mannerisms.

I ordered the quesadilla with goat cheese and red bell pepper marmalade. It was tasty. However the inner portion of the tortilla was soft and soggy from the cheese yet the ends were crisp and too brittle. All in all the dish was a good combination of flavors and adequately priced for the ingredients.

The coffee was good. That is a huge plus. 

Finally they changed service in between our visit. A bit weird. An introduction would have been nice. They did not offer to refill my coffee nor served us water. Was their a shortage that I was not aware of?

We either find something near where we plan to go, something in route, or just plain go out of our way to have some place that has gotten killer reviews. This place is not the third one yet, but was on our way (mostly) to Goodyear. We were headed out for a ball game (of course). 

From the direction we were heading, there was no real perfect exit to get off the 10, so we did a little round a bout thing. But, we got there and found it. Take a good look at the pictures, it helps when you are searching for this place. We got parked with no difficulty and were worried that the place might not even be open. It is pretty desolate around this area. Not too ""scary"" as Matt K's sister thinks, at least not at 10am in the morning. 

THe place is cute. A triangular building with lots of windows. No huge sign to advertise, but maybe just being on YELP will help them. We walked in to the small main dining area. Lots of white ikea tables and chairs with cute flowers on all of them. Bright drapery covering the sunny side of the building's windows. Lots of natural light in here and very inviting. The staff greeted us right away and asked us to order up at the counter, as they do not have menus printed yet. So, I assume that is coming. 

We walked through the doorway into more of a kitchen area that had a counter setup and a large board with menu items. There are daily lunch specials, about 6-7 breakfast items, a lunch menu and a heafty list of specialty drinks. This place is really a true ""Asian"" Fusion, incompasing all of Asia. But, with a dabble in a few extra places, we will just call this world fusion. There are lots of really creative dishes and things that I would not necessarily have put together. But, they work.

Inside there were veggies (too many onions for me, I will omit them next time), including carrots, cilantro, and tomato. They give you a side of sweet chili sauce to top it. Other than the onions that I fished most of out, this was DELICIOUS. I am not sure how they did the egg, but I do not have to know. I just have to eat it. SG ordered a scrambled egg plate with stir fried asian veggies. He loved the combination and was surprised to find how great it all was together. 

We both stepped outside our norms and also got a specialty tea. We ordered the Indian Chai. It was very good. There were lots of other choiced that tempted me, but this one struck me first. I would love to go back and try the Ginger Lemonade. I am a sucker for ginger!

Overall, this is a good little place with some really fresh, tasty, creative menu items. I hope that the lunch traffic can sustain them, since they have such potential. COME ON YELPERS, get in there and check it out. It is close enough to stop in for breakfast or lunch and get a little bite, even if you take it out, rather than eating in.",2,4,-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg,review,0
Rjwd7V57in6lS2_Bo2e28A,vxgU5nh4tkNY4-NQI8lhvQ,2009-03-12,1,"3.5 to be exact...Came here for lunch yesterday, and enjoyed the gorgeous weather over a glass of...gazpacho? 

The space is really bright and airy, we went up and ordered at the counter and then slipped outside and moved our table into the sunshine. The man-friend and I split the veggie pasta special, the veggie sandwich, a glass of gazpacho, and each had a glass of ginger lemonade. Our lemonade came out first, and it was good. Not as gingery as I like it, but not surprising. I like a lot of ginger. 

Next out was the gazpacho. The chef (and I think owner?) mentioned that she was from Spain, so I knew I had to give it a try. It was listed under drinks, but I didn't really imagine that it would actually come out in a glass with ice and a straw. I got over the presentation quickly. This was THE BEST gazpacho I've had in years. Totally pureed, garlicky, with breadcrumbs in the mix so it tastes a bit creamy. Basically, the real freakin deal. 

It didn't take long for the rest of our meal to make it out. The pasta was really flavorful, with heaps of veggies piled on top of a hearty serving. The veggie sandwich wasn't a new favorite, but it wasn't bad, either. Both came with mixed greens salads and a vinaigrette. The salad was tender, the dressing was alright. 

We had a bit of a glitch with our bill on the way out. Everything is manually entered into the system, old school style, so take a closer peek at your check. 

There were lots of other tasty looking things on the menu like the Gypsy stew, pear and gorgonzola sandwich and some breakfast items, so we'll definitely be back.",1,3,-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg,review,1

The food tastes as though it were served off your own stove, with grandma at the spoon. It's homey and tasty. I had the chiken potato soup (the daily special $6.50) and it was very tasty, accompanied by 3 toasted baguette slices, served dry for dipping, and a mixed green salad with a fruity vinegarette. The portions were perfect. I ordered the morroccan mint tea with much anticipation, but to my dismay it was not what i had in Morroco or Tunisia. I guess serving a tea glass filled completely to the rim with mint and tea will have to be a home made thing. ( Thinking back to my travels i wonder where they grew all that friggin mint? They had to sell it in bushells with the amounts in each glass.) My nephew ordered the chicken panini and it was delicious, but cost $7 because it comes with a salad.

There was a steady flow of patrons, so the food will rest assured be fresh. Not to many people know about the place which makes getting in and out easy. Best part is this location is directly across the street from ShopDevious.com so you can shop and eat on your lunch break with time to spare. 

On the bad side, i tried to sit outside to enjoy the fresh air, but the street was so unleveled i ended up sitting sideways at the table which was on a downward slope, and my soup seeped over the edge until i could make a dent with the spoon, ending up all over my tray and plate. Next time i'll sit inside. Good thing the food was too good to notice the slope after the first bite (i even picked up my bowl holding it in hand at one point) it was so delicious.",1,3,-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg,review,1

The girl working was totally adorable and sat us down with some menus. She immediately started gushing about the lentil salad, so I didn't get much time to look closely at the menu. I was too worried about hurting her feelings NOT to order the lentil salad, so we settled on that and the eggplant panini sans cheese.

salad.
ever.
Extremely fresh tasting, local greens, lentils, and other veggies in a barely there lemon vinaigrette.  And some pita on the side.
The panini was okay. Yummy rustic whole wheat bread.
As we munched, I noticed the lush little patch of garden growing by the telephone pole outside. A grip of basil just basking away in DIRECT SUNLIGHT and looking fantastic. WTF I couldn't keep mine alive for a week!

I've given this place several tries. Every time the service is terrible. They're understaffed (even when we were the only table there... one person working at a restaurant isn't possible), and if there are more than three employees there at once, they always get confused. I'm not sure what the reason is...the place only has like eight tables. 

Second, the atmosphere is depressing. Sapna has a really different setting in the tip of the Bragg's Pie building. If anything, the atmosphere should be the automatic winner. Instead, it's a plain white room with plain white plastic tables. Last time I was in there, the one painting hanging on the wall fell off, hitting a patron in the head. Then it took several minutes for the server to get him some ice. He had a nice ole welt.

When I got home and opened the bag of take out, my gypsy stew was placed in a 6.0z  to go coffee cup. I was a little put off by that, and then I look down and the garbanzo bean salad was placed in the smallest lil' container I have ever seen.

Sapna is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix, and I am so fortunate to live just down the street. The owner, Anna, is from Spain and has travelled the world, and she competently reflects her time in Spain, India, Mexico, and elsewhere in her dishes. 

The food is most important, and this is where Sapna shines. A regular at the Downtown Farmers Market -- both as a vendor and a buyer -- Anna's food is local, fresh, organic, and filled with vegan and vegetarian options. Rarely do I order off the menu, as Sapna's specials reflect what just came off the farm. Yes, I have had a dish or two that didn't wow me, but the homemade pasta is some of the best I've ever had, and the paella is right out of Spain (when it is included with the specials).

The space is small, but charming. Shaped like a slice of pie with large windows on both sides of the angles, the spot in the Bragg's Pie Building is fun, casual, and filled with local art for sale. The floors are unfinished, the furniture is from Ikea, and the tables have basil or whatever is currently growing in the outside containers in small vases; and sometimes they are growing roots in the water. High end? No. Quirky? Sure.

The service is friendly, but can be slow if the place gets full. If you want fast and typical, Sapna is not for you. If you like fresh and local from a talentePhoenix owner/chef, put this place on the top of your list!",0,4,-Y9woV5m-KaTzu9VpirYyg,review,0

We were seated relatively fast and our orders were taken in short order, but after that service came to a grinding halt. The menu is limited in general but the sandwiches looked great, of course that was not what I ordered. I went for the $5 gypsy stew which was really tasty, but I was served a portion that should have cost $1.25. I mean seriously, soup is the classic poor people food, this had like 16 garbanzos, a few random veggies floating around in it and a little bit of potato. For $5 I could have made at least a gallon of soup. Please at least serve a portion that isn't blatant about ripping me off. Thank you. Because I'd gone light on dinner I ordered the olive oil cake thing I'd seen at the register with a tag on it that said $2.50 a slice. The cake came out with a side of 4 cantaloupe cubes and 1 strawberry in some glaze. The cake was nice, pretty much the consistency of corn bread and no heavy olive flavor. I'd never had it before so weee, new things in my mouth.  When it came time to pay my $2.50 slice of cake morphed into a $5.50 dessert. Say what? 

I am infinitely annoyed by price gouging and none of this food is spectacularly intricate or worth the wait. When I tell you that we waited 30 minutes for 4 sandwiches and 1 cup of soup I am not speaking in hyperbole.

It is located on the outer edge of Place Ville Marie's food court somewhat close to the entrance the Central Station (Gare Centrale). During lunch time there will usually be a line-up at this place, however, the line moves surprisingly very fast.

When I am in the mood for soup at work for lunch, I will normally come here and have one of ""Vietnamese"" soups since I don't have to worry about the weather conditions outside as this place is within PVM and PVM is one of the buildings connected to the ""underground city"". The soups aren't as good as a place like Pho Lien but I find it good nevertheless. Not that it makes any difference to me but this ""Vietnamese"" restaurant is run/managed by Cantonese speaking workers (it might also be owned by them) so you won't get the variety/authenticity of a place like Pho Lien for Vietnamese soup.

The bowl size for the soup is decent. When eating at the food court, they ask you to bring back the bowl after you're finished.

Overall the quality of the food was excellent. We went on a weekend lunch when it wasn't so busy, so the staff were very quick and served us right away.
We ordered a soondobu, jap chae, and this fried fish dish. The soondobu was very hot, lots of ingredients, fresh, and spicy. Comparable to many other Korean restaurants I have been too. The Jap Chae wasn't overly oil and had lots of flavour. The fried fish, which I never remember the name is a staple of this place, I never tried it anywhere else (probably because I never see it on other restaurants menus), but if you love fish, this is something you should try. I've asked the owners there before about the dish and they told me it was a specialty dish and you usually can't find it in other Korean restaurants. A fair warning though, this fish does have bones and is not a fillet but some of the bones can be chewed through. 
The only thing about this place is the korean videos that seem to loop weeks on end. But then again, a lot of these family owned Korean restaurants share the same videos. I wonder if they are hooked up to 1 central server to Airplay these videos.

I am a fan and would definitely return! As far as Korean food goes, they had all the standard offerings of pork bone soup, kalbi, etc. and the much-anticipated and loved accompaniment of side dishes! the side dishes were good but of standard fair! the dishes that we tried (beef stir fry placed in lettuce wraps, deep fried sweet and spicy chicken, and chicken ribs and cabbage) were - for the most part - delicious and of heafy proportions! 

i quite enjoyed what we ordered - the chicken ribs (which translated means dark meat) and cabbage! a melange of cabbage, half cooked chicken morsels, sweet potato and onions (?) are served in a big flat pan over a portable gas burner - so it required a little bit of eater participation! they get the process going by turning on the burner and giving it a little stir, then they intermittently come back to stir it around and scrap the bottom of the pan where the sauce and meat/veg caramelize. what you're left with is a hot bowl of goodness that hits all the notes of sweet, spicy and savoury. we actually figured out what to order by covertly staring at (and eventually asking) the family beside us what they were eating. the aroma, the hot sizzling sounds and the overall appearance of what was going on at their table led us to overcome our chinese politeness to ask. 

the other dish that resonated with me was the deep fried sweet and spicy chicken. our dining mates had it and at our next visit, *i* too will have it! it was delicious! maybe because i haven't had korean chicken in a while or possibly because it was simultaneously crispy + saucy, spicy + sweet (a favored flavour combo of mine), and light + toothsome. i don't know how this dish could possess so many opposing qualities but it did. i think it was battered in rice flour? or just something other than your regular cornstarch because it was a little ""stickier"" in texture - which i liked - so after your initial crunch down into the crispy exterior, your teeth meet a little resistance from the sticky-ish batter that hugs the meat and then through the tender chicken. i'm biased to sweet + spicy, so the sauce got me at first bite. i have to say, my ""can i try a piece?"" turned into more like 5+ pieces ... and to my shame, not of the small and dainty variety. oh and value wise, this dish was huge ... enough for dinner + lunch the next day (for 2 people).

both dishes came with the colourful purple rice - BIG PLUS in my books! 

the only mediocre dish was the beef stir fry - and not worth really writing about.

Why you may ask?
Simple.
1. The staff is friendly and are Japanese.  This is not your typical cheap Chinese or Korean owned Japanese restaurant where you get sketchy sushi. The service is fast, but if you wait more than a couple of minutes for your order to come they apoplogise and offer you tea (hot tea for winter and cold tea in the summer). The staff here understand how to make the diner feel welcome and number one. 
2. The fish is fresh.  There is no second guessing when it comes to their food. One of my favourites is the spicy tuna roll which is actually spicy.  We usually order a 20 piece boat which is delicious.

I was waiting for my friend to show up at Cobra Nightclub; already three things I don't like.  King Street West, Nightclubs (especially Cobra), and waiting.
I thought I'd pop in for a quick and inexpensive bite so that I would have energy for the debauchery which proceeded me this evening.

The restaurant is narrow, and it has five or six tables.  On the walls hung original painting which were also for sale.  Super quiet, it was only myself, and another table occupying the space.  There was light dinner jazz in the background which I would therapeutic.  
Real Japanese people here btw.

I ordered a few dishes, and then my eye landed on the one thing I couldn't possibly refuse.  Foie gras sushi!  What on Earth?!  I MUST TRY IT!

I absolutely hate it when I am sat next to a couple who are in the interviewing phase of their date.  Talking about their goals in life, what they expect from a relationship in all aspects.  I tried to drown out the next table's conversation, but the jazz was too soft in this completely quiet restaurant.
I wanted to kill myself...I'm pretty sure I made a facebook status update about how much the next table made me want to kill myself.

The food came at a reasonable paste, and finally when the foie gras arrived..I stared at it drooling.  The piece of foie gras was definitely generous considering the size of the rice roll.  I picked it up with my chop stick, and slowly watched it enter my mouth.  As soon as it touched my tongue, the flavours exploded into a million colourful balloons of butterfly happiness.  And for the duration of my chewing, I completely forgot that a single piece of this sushi cost me $7.00.

1) This is the closest thing to Japanese sushi you'll get in Toronto at a relatively reasonable price.  REASONABLE PRICE - that's the catch phrase here.
2) Some who do not know quality Sushi may complain it's too expensive, but that's because they are comparing this place to Chinese run joints like Sushi on Queen, Sushi Time, etc.  This place has a Japanese sushi chef so to view this place with proper perspective, compare it to other joints that have Japanese sushi chefs.  Consider the costs at Hiro, Ematei and Nami.  All of a sudden the price isn't that unreasonable.
3) When I give this place a 5 star rating, I do so considering the PRICE.  
4) Do not ever order anything from the kitchen without consulting various review sites.  The kitchen chef is not talented in any way.  You come here for sushi and/or sashimi.  That's it.  

What I usually get is the 20 piece sushi party plate @ $28.

When Susur was working at his restaurant, long ago, he was often seen eating here.  The place is authentic.

If you're sick and tired of Chinese or Korean run sushi restaurants that think they can make decent Sushi just because the guy behind the bar happens to be Asian and has a big knife, check this place out and do a taste test.  A Japanese sushi chef, trained in Japan, makes all the difference.",2,5,DQLhafBySo3p2EJudn-7WA,review,1

I first came here with my parent after it being recommended to me by a friend, assuring me it was the best Thai restaurant in Edinburgh by miles, and whilst not quite that good (that honour goes to Thai Orchid), it is definitely up there. The staff are quiet but pretty friendly, and are efficient without being overbearing. 

The food is great, if a bit expensive. They do set menus for those watching their wallets but I always find the dishes available quite restrictive, so we went for the a la carte. The mixed starter is like most Thai places, with the standard spare ribs, spring rolls, fishcakes etc but they were all cooked exceptionally. For a main course I had Tiger prawns with asparagus, garlic and soy sauce, which was beautifully flavoured. The other dishes were all good but their seafood is definitely the speciality. The only problem is that it is expensive, the seafood dishes averaging about  13, not including rice.

ev_-x0q1wztR1Lus9ozIHA,HvQ576LJm6i6QZuTwl7WVg,2013-04-04,5,"Seeing so many Thai restaurants with a mixture of extremely positive and negative reviews, I was a little anxious about booking anywhere. I am a student with a limited budget, so eating out is an occasion (here a reward for having finished all my assignments), and the Thai restaurant I chose had to be a very good one.

I looked at about 5 other places in town. Some were too expensive, some didn't offer enough in the way of veggie food, others were just too far away. I was considering a takeaway, when I suddenly noticed for the first time ever the Celadon which is just across the road from me. I can literally just cross the road and I'm on the doorstep. The next task was to check it was okay online. Yelp and other sites all pointed in the same direction: ""top notch"" and ""entirely faultless"" service, delicious authentic food and good value. Being so close, I had to check it out.

The menu is deceptive. It doesn't look very vegetarian, but it turns out they are willing to vegetarianize just about everything on the menu, are conscious about dietary problems and don't use shrimp paste! Yay!

I booked for 7.30 today. Before 8pm from Monday-Thursday there is a pre-theatre menu, where you get a starter and a main for  12.99. Upon entering we noticed  that the place was pretty empty, there was just one other couple eating. We put this down to the out of the way location, but after half an hour it suddenly filled up! The interior is minimalist and tastefully decorated, nothing too intrusive. The waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. 

My boyfriend ordered from the pre-theatre menu: spring rolls with sweet chilli sauce, pad thai with tofu. I ordered a green curry with tofu and thai sticky rice. My boyfriend Robbie thought his starter was a bit small, but very much enjoyed it and his main made up for the small starter size. His pad thai came with the peanuts and various spices on the side (to sprinkle over the noodles), and a small salad. He said it was delicious, but after tasting some of mine he looked jealously at my dish every so often. Mine was super spicy, with plenty of red chillies in the sauce, fragrant herbs and spices, big chunks of fried tofu and plenty of fresh crunchy vegetables. My rice came in a bamboo bag which was used to steam it. The portion size was massive, but it was so good that I ate more or less everything. 

Thai puddings are amongst my favourites. Robbie opted for the banana fritter with coconut ice cream, whilst I went for the banana cooked in sweet coconut milk. Strangely enough, this is a quite nostalgic dish for me as I used to eat it a lot when I went out for dinner with my grandparents. It is relatively healthy in comparison to other dessert options, and really rather delicious. The presentation of both pudding was really beautiful, and Robbie wolfed his pudding down despite having declared he was stuffed a few seconds before. He added that it was the best part of the meal... 

For  30 for two without drinks, it wasn't that expensive. I am not sure why Thai is always pricier than other places, but Celadon is cheaper than most but definitely superior to most. Fresh ingredients are well cooked, service is, as Emily H stated, ""flawless"". I would definitely come back here to sample some of the other dishes on offer.",1,5,6UN4nw_oIMbZRjtqmtH3lQ,review,2

The d cor is elegant and the ambiance quiet and intimate. The chefs use only fresh ingredients (no pre-frozen nastiness) and there is no MSG in their dishes. The difference is obvious from the first bite of tender massman lamb, Bangkok beef, or succulent 5-spices duck, or generous Pad Thai. Honestly, after all my visits, I have never tasted anything that wasn't superb.


 Also, as a displaced American foodie, I have been missing the level of service we Yanks prefer. Celedon employs (or is she the owner's wife? Hmm) the best server I have encountered in my time in the UK.

Die beiden Einheimischen schlugen den Schwanen vor, weil es Esslingens einzige (Haus-)Brauerei darstellt. Die Hausbrauerei liegt mitten in Esslingens Altstadt an sehr ruhigem Platz, bei sch nem Wetter kann man davor Platz nehmen. 
Innen war ich allerdings etwas entt uscht. Von au en dachte ich, man betritt uriges gem tliches Brauereilokal - aber wer hat hier in den 70er oder 80er renoviert und ausgestattet? Sch u licher und ungem tlicher Fliesenboden, Kunstlederbezogene billige M bel - geht null. Derweil w ren die Grundlagen da: massive Holzdecke, Riesenbalken sichtbar, Ausstattung erinnert zwar an engl. Club und nicht an Brauhaus, ging aber. W rde als Sofortl sung f r den erh hen Seitenraum vorschlagen, 2 gro e r tliche Teppiche auf Fliesen zu legen und Tische wei  einzudecken, dann sieht man weniger vom Boden und nix von den h sslichen Tischen mehr. Und auf Werbebierdeckel von Germanwings sollte auch verzichtet werden - schaut sch big aus. Wie die Lage mit den Toiletten zu retten ist: keine Ahnung. Ich musste erst paar Stufen runter zum Tresen, dann Wendeltreppe runter, durch modrig riechenden Barraum durch, paar Treppenstufen hoch, wieder durch weiteren Kellernebenraum, paar Stufen runter und dann war ich da. Erfreulicherweise tiptop neu gemachte, saubere WC-Anlage. Aber beim Weg zur ck (s.o.) verfliegt der Eindruck dann leider. 
Die Karte war sehr angenehm gehalten.  bersichtlich, klein und erg nzt durch Tages/Wochenkarte auf Schiefertafeln. Preislich eher f r das Ambiente und den Service zu ambitioniert, aber Touris werden ja keine Stammg ste. Ich w hlte:
- Schwanen M rzen (0,3 f r 3,20 ) und sp ter, will ja probieren
- Schwanen Pilsener (0,3 f r 3,20)
- Geeiste sommerliche Tomatensuppe (4 )
(Stand auf Tafel vor Gasthaus, beim Bestellen war sie aus, beim Verlassen des Lokals stand sie immernoch drau en..). Folglich umdisponiert:
- Maultaschensuppe (4,50)
- Spinat-Kokos-Suppe (ca. 5,00  - beide Begleiter)
- Zarter Kalbstafelspitz im eigenen Sud, Gem sestreifen, frischer Kren und Kartoffeln (14,80 )
- Kalbsfetzen Orientalisch mit Sucuk, Kichererbsen, Zwiebeln, Kartoffeln (18,80  - Begleitung). 
Die Biere waren beide ok - aber recht charakterlos f r kleine (Haus)brauerei. Meine Suppe schmeckte sehr gut. Die Maultaschen waren hervorragend und reichhaltig, die Br he selbstgemacht. Die Spinat-Kokossuppe schmeckte nur nach Spinat, fand ich eher entt uschend - optisch aber sehr ansprechend.
Der Tafelspitz wurde in drei extra Teilen serviert: Fleisch im Sud, Kren, Kartoffeln. Alles f r sich gut, aber bl d zu essen. Soll man Kartoffeln trocken essen oder in Sud tauchen? Hm, aber das Fleisch superzart, geschmacklich gut gelungen und der Sud merklich selbst und mit Liebe gemacht. H tte aber alles auf Teller serviert und statt Kren eher Apfelmeerrettich zu Kartoffeln und Fleisch gereicht.

Das Brauhaus zum Schwanen? Immernoch ein Geheimtipp!
Wir waren (wieder mal) spontan und unanagemeldet in einem der besten esslinger Restaurants. Nach einer kurzen Wartezeit am sehr gem tlichen Tresen, wo wir schon mal unser hevorragendes Bockbier trinken konnten, bekamen wir einen wie immer angenehmen Tisch f r zwei. Mit das Sch ne am Schwanen ist, dass die Tische nicht wie in den meinsten anderen Restaurants auf ""Hautkontakt zu anderen Tischen"" gestellt sind, sondern gen gend Platz dazwischen gelassen wurde, dass man weder gest rt wird noch sich in der weite verlassen f hlt.
Als Vorspeise nahmen wir einen frischen,knackigen, liebevoll angemachten Salat, der weder in der hausgemachten Tunke ers uft war noch sich nach mehr Dressing sehnte und eine leckere Fl dlesuppe wie von Muttern.
Als Hauptgang hatten wir Rindezunge im eigenen Sud von der Tageskarte. Die Zunge zerging auf der Zunge, kam im Suppenteller sch n angerichtet mit frischem, auf den Punkt gekochtem Gem se und hervorragenden KArtoffeln. Ebenfalls von der Tageskarte, die immer herrlich ausgeglichen und einfallsreich gestaltet ist, kam der Zander auf Blumenkohlp rree, das samtig und leicht mit dem Fisch harmonierte.

Die K che war wie immer hervorragend, die Zutaten frisch und lecker zu bereitet, mit Liebe angerichtet und durch einen spitzenm  igen Service kredenzt.
Der Service im Schwanen ist wie immer nicht nur freundlich, sondern auch zuvorkommend. Sollte man Lust auf andere oder weitere Beilagen haben, bekommt man immer einen passenden und durchdachten Rat. Immer ist der Service sehr pers nlich, geistreich und herzlich!

Die Einrichtung wirkt keinesfalls ""billig"" wie hier von einem Vorkritiker beschrieben. Sicherlich ist die Einrichtung individuell, weil kreativ und nicht durchschnittlich. Die Massivholztische sind stabil und durchaus f r ein ""Brauhaus"" passend. Die Sitzgelegenheiten sind gem tlich. Das Design der beiden Gastr ume ist grundlegend unterschiedlich, was eine Bereicherung bedeutet. Wir f hlen uns hier sehr wohl.

Durch die Anordnung der Tische ist trotz des offenen Raumes immer eine gewisse Intimit t gewahrt. man hat eben so viel Abstand, dass man seine Ruhe hat, aber nicht soviel dass man sich verloren f hlt. Durch den zentralen, runden Abgang zum Kellergeschoss hat man eine sch ne, f r den Einrichter nicht unkomplizierte Raumaufteilung, die aber perfekt gel st wurde.
Im Eingangsbereich pr sentieren sch ne stilvolle Schr nkchen die Spezialit ten, durch die der Schwanen besonders gl nzt. Stehtischchen machen das Warten auf einen freien Tisch bei gro em Andrang und fehlender vorheriger Reservierung angenehm. Auch hier wird man vom Service nicht einfach abgestellt, sondern betreut und gut versorgt.

Tats chlich ist die Toilettensituation nicht so ganz begl ckend. Das sind aber nun mal die baulichen Gegebenheiten. Aber auch hier gl nzt das Brauhaus mit sauberen, durchdachten und neuen sanit ren Anlagen. Nach einem ordentlichen Essen schadet ein kleiner Gang durch die Katakomben ja nun auch nicht...

Insgesamt f hlen wir uns im Brauhaus zum Lamm immer sehr wohl, essen spitzenm  ig und trinken ebenso gut.

Das Ambiente innen passt sich dem an: Eher dunkel gehalten, leider mit einem Kachelboden, so dass die Lautst rke nicht geschluckt, sondern eher hallend verbreitet wird.
Neben der Speisenkarte, die in der Standardversion auch auf der Website zu finden ist, gibt es die aktuellen Angebote, die auf Schiefertafeln pr sentiert sind. Die Auswahl kann man wohl mit ""gutb rgerlich"" umschreiben, fleischlastig zu Normalpreisen, oft auch als kleinere Portion angeboten.
Wir w hlten als Vorspeise ein Urzitronen-Carpaccio (8,50  ): Diese Zitrone hat bei weitem nicht die gewohnte S ure, sondern kann samt Schale gegessen werden, wobei letztere den Gro teil der Frucht ausmacht. W re sie hauchd nn geschnitten gewesen, w re sie auch angenehmer zu essen gewesen, so war doch etwas kauen angesagt. Der Geschmack war bestens kombiniert mit Rucola, etwas N ssen und Tomaten, also eine geschmacklich vortreffliche Idee. Die Kalbszunge (11,80  ) wurde in einem Suppenteller mit einem leichten Sud serviert. Die Zunge herrlich zart, dazu noch etwas Gem se und Salzkartoffeln. Originell auch dieses in der Pr sentation und gut. Wuchtig waren das Kalbshaxenfleisch (14,80  ) mit einer deftigen Sauce, Ratatouille und R sti. Gut aufeinander abgestimmt und intensiv!
Die Mandeltorte (6,50  ) war zwar warm, leider auch schon etwas trocken, was durch das gute Eis auch nicht ""geheilt"" werden konnte.

09jyGdYcf6ykBM1On_Y2cA,sccPVgHWRAww1atzaOfOYQ,2010-12-07,5,"Le Rossignol is a small and intimate bistro newly opened in Leslieville (taking over Pop Bistro's space). And on a cold wintry night, there's nothing more satisfying than classic French cuisine to fuel and fortify a body against the chill.

Or if you're me, be a glutton and not be able to focus on anything else but a couch on which to play beached-whale during the entire trip home. I tried to solo this meal and perhaps that was not a good call. But I digress! Let's talk about the food.

After I settle in at my table, an amuse comes out from the kitchen - a butternut soup with coconut foam. The scent of five-spice wafts up from the hot ceramic shot-glass and it is a delicious way to warm up. Quite nice.

A hot bowl of French onion soup is up next - not too salty, really nice flavour, and islands of floating toasted crisps tangled in a mess of melted cheese. It's a hefty portion of soup, good for sharing. Of course, I ate it all by myself.

The kitchen clearly thought I didn't have enough to eat this evening (I had two - yes two - mains still yet to come), so a small quenelle of a duck terrine on a crisp gets placed in front of me. Meaty and a little vinegary, this mouthful was a nice way to perk up the taste buds again. A nice and unexpected treat.

I couldn't resist and got the house-made pasta of the night: Linguine with pulled boar, mushrooms, and laced with truffle oil. There was mention of tomatoes, but it was a fairly light note. Rich and delicious, this was a deceptively large portion of pasta due to the plate being more bowl-like than you'd think. Very filling and worth a try if they still have it on the menu.

By now I was pretty full. And what's next? Cassoulet. It landed on the table and this plate of beans, half a sausage, and two confit duck legs mocked me. The peanut gallery of lardons laughed. I tried valiantly, but I got through half a leg, a slice of sausage, and a few spoonfuls of beans before I called it quits.

The waitress enquires if I want dessert? I'm stuffed, but of course!

I opted for a pot de cr me trio (it's small, right?) in mango, berry, and apple (in order of preference). The mango was light and delicious and not as mangoey as it could have been. Better that way, I think. The berry (cassis, I think), in contrast, was quite strong and worked well. The texture was a bit off though. I'd have opted to pass on the apple in the end.

A pot of loose-leaf tea (earl grey. hot.), strong and black, accompanied dessert in an effort to make more room in my stomach. It did its job, though I still felt like I was going to explode.

All in all, a promising new neighbourhood place I'd return to sometime (can't think about when right now - too full). Added bonus is the fact that real French gets bandied about between the FOH and kitchens. Adds that extra je ne sais quois to the evening.

Frisee salad w/ lardons and poached egg: nice and yolky, an excellent salad.

Pate main served w/ toast and jam. Meaty w/o being salty and the jam added a sweet note. Lovely.

Cassoulet: It was -5C out so this dish really hit the spot. Two confit duck legs, rosemary herbed sausage and white beans slow cooked until al dente and flavorful. The duck legs might've been a little chewier than usual, but still a good, hearty, filling dish.

Roast wild boar chop: Cooked medium w/ an excellent, slightly sweet glaze, mashed potatoes, baby carrots and crunchy broccolini. The flavors and textures were wonderful, an excellent dish.

Chocolate cake: deep, chocolatey flavor, with just enough sweetness to allow you to enjoy the chocolatey taste w/o being sugary, sickly sweet.

I also read the National Post's (http://tinyurl.com/4htvoet) review the day after visiting and although it was a little bit harsher than I would have said it, it was on the money. 

A bit of confusion finding our reservation at first, but once done we were warmly shown to our table. The wine list was a little overpriced ($14/glass for middle of the road) for what it had on it, but of the two glasses that I tried, they were nice accompaniments to what I ate. 

I started with the quintessential escargots and my wife had soup of the day - creme of pear and parsnip. The escargots were excellent. Plump and nestled nicely in butter and Gruyere. The soup was thick and rich and thankfully wasn't overpowering in either pear or parsnip. Nice little starter. 

We also shared another special of the day - a small order of rabbit rillette with crostini. A little heavy on garlic but a light dish that was rather quickly devoured. 

Mains next. I had the wild boar which was...ok. I partially blame myself as when I had the mental image in my head, it wasn't the same as the pork chop that appeared in front of me. The Yukon mash and carrots were delicate and lovely to eat. The roasted garlic / jus that came with the boar didn't add too much to the taste that was just familiar. The $27 price for this plate was a tad too much as well. 

Now, the moules et frites that my wife ordered were fantastic. Neither of us had ordered very many tomato-based mussel dishes (used to wine or curry/cream based) and this order was brilliant. Mussels were big fat bastards and picked up the broth flavour very well. Extra bread for dipping was definitely needed. Couldn't even finish the order. The mini-string frites were very tasty and the perfect lemon aioli dip was tip top. 

The place filled quickly past 7-7:30 p.m. with every demographic possible, showing that this little placed is like by all. We planned it well time-wise, as with our table tucked in the corner near the ordering station, the place gets packed by 9. 

Staff were very friendly, pleasant and timed their visits perfectly. At least one server speaking French with a multitude of tables.

I almost hate to write a review of this place, because I don't want anyone to know about it and thus be able to keep this wonderfully intimate French restaurant all to myself and my husband. Every time we come here, it's not very crowded and we're free to make goo-goo eyes at each other over dinner without making anyone want to toss their moules frites. But, this place is too sweet not to share, so consider yourselves warned if you spot us in a corner, canoodling over crevettes. ;) 

Standouts here include the escargot poutine (yes, you read that right!) and the coq au vin. Both items are rich, hearty, and perfect stick-to-your-ribs comfort food. I also really like the duck breast with cassoulet, which is another hearty choice. The filet and frites are also good, but nothing special. 

The wine list is decent; on the small side, but well-curated. The server, a lovely Montreal woman, sets the atmosphere with her lovely French accent and welcoming (if slightly frazzled) attitude.

But then they couldn't figure out how to market it. So they decided to turn that obstacle course into a restaurant instead, and they called it the Penn City Grill.

Now, the food isn't too bad, and the sushi is decent. But the service is so slow and so inefficient at the Penn City Grill, that it's almost comical to watch the waitstaff run back and forth, without any rhyme or reason, because anything you ask for -- menu, silverware, napkins, check -- requires at minimum two laps around the obstacle course.

So eventually, I stopped expecting the waitstaff to come around, and just enjoyed the show. Never mind that the restaurant is at most 25% full. Stuff just takes that long.

Initially drawn in by the bacon and salamis (in hopes that we could sneak something back home to the US), my dining partner and I returned for the outstanding sausage sandwiches.

We both ended up getting swiss cheese infused sausages-- positively bubbling with mild, gooey cheese-- with mustard and pickles as a nod to a classic Cuban sandwich. Seeing everyone else order saurkraut we opted for a little of that too... and were stunned. This, friends, is one of the most perfect sandwiches I've ever eaten.

The baguette on which the toppings were served was chewy, crunchy, and hot. The saurkraut-- something I'm not normally a fan of-- was crunchy and fresh and provided a nice mildly acidic counter to the rich, fatty sausage. Solid mustard and tasty pickles. 

My dining partner and I sat in silence just savoring these sandwiches.

To note-- if ordering from the food cart, pay inside first and get a number. Kudos to the friendly clerk willing to make us sandwiches even though we hadn't done this formality before stepping in line.

While I admit the Channa Masala entree I had was tasty, the lady working told me that they buy it frozen from a bag, dump it out, and heat it up on top of rice for $8. I don't know what's happened, because this was a decent place to grab a sandwich and coffee a few years ago, and now their menu is 1/4 of the size and it's often deserted.

The sandwich itself was delicious. A great blend of flavors, though I found it a little difficult to eat at times.

First impression...what a cute cafe!  It's clean and cool with some tables and a little seating area with leather chairs.  There's also a small private room with a conference table in it.   Bathroom is clean and modern.  

Then onto the ordering - it's fast casual style.   I was sort of reminded of a trip to the doctor's office because it was a really clinical experience.   The lady at the counter was really slow and rather uninspired by her work.  Turns out we'd interrupted her lunch, which she went out to the dining area to eat after she waited on us.  My lunch was served to-go.  Not sure why since she didn't ask. 

The food was mixed.  The jalape o popper panini I had was pretty good.  Creamy and cheesy, with a punch from some sliced jalape os.   It was pretty large too.  The hash brown tater tots were straight from the Ore Ida bag.  Not bad, but pretty generic.   The sandwich, tots, bottle of water, and random bag of chips I didn't order came to just over $10.

Not so lucky for my pants which have been feeling the stretch of this staple of my diet for some time now. I don't know what it is about this burrito-maybe they warm the tortilla in butter before filling it with tasty beans and cheese. Maybe it's the fact that they likely cook those beans in lard, which let's be honest, makes all the difference. I don't know, but if I knew I could live off of these without dropping dead of heart disease, I'd do it. 

There aren't many things I order here- the enchilada plate, the bean and cheese burrito and from time to time the carne asada nachos which are a day and a half's worth of calories and sodium, but worth it. I only recommend the carne asada when it comes to nachos- the chicken just has never been good when I've had it. Nothing to ruin a delicious plate of cheese and chips like dry flavorless chicken. My favorite salsa is the green-not too spicy and packs in some great tomatillo flavor. If you go inside you can get as many little containers of salsa as you want, which brings me to my next point. 

Don't get in the drive through lane unless you like to be tortured before your meal. I've made the mistake many a time of  hopping in the drive through lane because I simply didn't want to get out of my car and I regretted it every single time.

I mean, I've actually pulled up at the same time as someone and have walked out with my food before the cars in front of them have received their food.

They also offer fruit smoothies if you want something that presumably tastes fresher.  We took our snacks home, and dug in.  We got four for two of us which I think is a good snack size.  The empanadas are quite small - maybe 4-5 bites each - if you wanted lunch, you might want 4 for yourself.

We tried the beef, the sausage, the chicken, and the spinach.  All were quite good - the crust looked and tasted unquestionably homemade.  They were hot and still a little shiny from the fryer.  The beef was my favorite - well seasoned, with a hint of olive flavor.  The chicken tasted very fresh.  The spinach was nice since it added a relatively healthy snack to the mix.  All of them were very good little bites.

Please come for a snack, and support a  local business.  Sounds like the coffee and pastries are really special - we didn't try either this time - so I will no doubt be back for more!",0,4,5kA4hmzNNWGGrwvoiGnIrg,review,0

GkrmHhcm0L6CpEzWfy7vXw,PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,2012-06-11,7," Az car! Is this the only Cuban bakery in Las Vegas? The sign advertises that they are ""like Porto's,"" where I've never been, but I understand is the west coast standard for Cuban bakeries. I also know that Porto's is approximately the size of the entire island of Cuba, which Roly's certainly is not. I'm from south Florida, where there's a lot more variety and competition for this style of bakery, but I can report that I'm very pleased to have Roly's here in Vegas.

My first visit (I was driving east on Tropicana and made a right turn with no notice when I saw a sign that said ""cuban coffee""), I started with my standard order: cafe con leche and a guava-cheese turnover. The turnover was good, but did not fully meet my expectations (a bit dry? not enough cream cheese?), and I was disappointed when my cuban espresso with steamed milk was served unsweetened. In Florida, it is automatically assumed that you want sugar, or they will ask, already fully prepared to pour a full cup of sugar into the hot espresso. Only in Las Vegas, and a small Cuban cafe in Tucson, has my coffee left me wondering, where's my az car? Sure, I can sweeten it myself, but I don't enjoy the guilty feeling of dumping loads of sugar into my coffee cup. I could continue this rant, but instead I will note that I'm glad that I selected a slice of guava cake to take home, as it tasted fresh and moist and convinced me that Roly's deserved another visit.

The selections I tried on my second trip were better. I found a slice of the guava strudel more pleasing than the turnover with cream cheese from my first visit, and was introduced to the masareal de coco, two layers of dense, cookie-like cake sandwiched with a sweet coconut filling. I also love the tocinillo de cielo, a dense, yellow flan on top of a layer of sponge cake that helps soak up the caramel syrup. In addition to desserts, Roly's does have a menu of savory options. My husband has tried the traditional pressed sandwich, and said it was OK, but he doesn't have much Cuban sandwich experience for comparison. Having never sampled Cuban pizza, I ordered a veggie, which came topped with fresh spinach, onions, green bell peppers, cheese, and a sweet tomato sauce with a hint of cumin. The crust was more like a thick round of focaccia, so it was a very bready pizza. I'm glad to have tried it once, but probably would not order it again.

Prices are very fair at Roly's: many of the desserts are under $1. Breakfast specials are cheap and worth checking out. Empanadas and papa rellena (those little fried mashed potato balls with a ground beef filling that people seem to be so obsessed with) are also available. Plus, the place is usually packed with Cubans taking multiple boxes of pastries to go. You may wait a bit for counter service, but I think that's a good sign.",6,4,ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag,review,5

Being in Vegas for a few months now I have been missing the pastelitos, Cuban bread, and sandwich.  I expected something a bit more authentic.  It's a shame the people of Las Vegas will equate Roly's Bakery with Cuban pastries since they probably don't know anything better.  First of all the Cuban bread wasn't authentic it was like the chewy bread Wal-Mart sells.  For those of you who've never had wonderful authentic Cuban bread, it has huge air pockets, is very very light in texture, with a crust that flakes almost like paper.  The pastelitos were as far away from authentic as the bread. Again, they missed the flakiness and  the taste was mediocre.

One thing that caught my eye about this place is a sign that touts that they have the best Cuban sandwiches. When someone makes that sort of claim, I don't just take their word for it. I take this matter into my own hands.

Walking in, I saw their array of baked goods right away. Some being traditional items like cheesecakes, croissants, as well as their own selection of treats of Hispanic influence. Everything looked absolutely delicious, but I had to pass since I was there looking for a meaty lunch. Those sweet treats were put there to distract me when I had a sign to challenge.

The Cuban sandwich comes to about $8 + tax. It comes with the traditional works: ham, sliced pork, some pickles, swiss cheese, and mustard served between their own baked bread. In terms of flavor, the sandwich could have had more, especially with their sliced pork. It wasn't a bad sandwich, but it left me feeling indifferent. I kinda like my Cuban sandwich a bit more greasy and toasty. Sorry Roly's, but this was not the best Cuban sandwich. It was a bit to plain for my tastes. I have to admit that the thing was gigantic though.
*3/5 stars based on the sandwich alone

I decided to bump the overall rating to 4 stars due to how delicious everything else looked. They even had chorizo pizza and empanadas, which I definitely have to come back to try. Their cakes are very extensive and have so many other baked goods that's sure to satisfy the sweet tooth. I'll keep that in mind the next time that I drop by.",4,4,ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag,review,2

I had the veggie omelet and the choritzo omelet.  Both were great with fresh ingredients.  But most impressive was the coffee.  They make a classic Cuban coffee with sugar, and they also make a great cafe con leche.

Interestingly, if you search for coffee houses in Las Vegas, almost all of them are some distance away from the strip.  I guess that is because the coffee houses serve people living here, not the tourists.  So this was a great find, although it will take a car to get there.  Highly recommended.

rshsfm757bJ8klIHIQ8xnw,eteU71BreWIONFxtIsCP9Q,2013-12-24,4,"I'm happy that my brother, a Las Vegas resident, knows all the decent bakeries in town. Since Roly's Cuban bakery is near McCarran, we often stop here before heading to my mom's when I fly into town. So if you get on Tropicana leaving the airport, turn right.  In front of UNLV is an old Strip Mall with Roly's facing campus. It's not much to look at from the outside. And it's not particularly descript on the inside until you look at the display cases full of pastries and the most beautiful cakes.

The two women working inside didn't speak much English, but I speak enough Spanish that with the menu having pictures and prices, it's no problem. Just point and pay - money speaks in all languages. My brother order a Hamburger.  The burger took about 10 minutes, and it smelled and tasted different in a good way.  There are several different types of burgers, but the regular $6.99 burger is a quarter pound patty, with a Cuban style bun.  Chorizo is blended into the meat patty, and cooked chorizo is part of the  toppings, along with mayo, and red bell peppers, I would give the burger 4 stars. It would be great with an IPA (which Roly's doesn't sell)

Pastries were kind of sparse at 5 PM but some good ones were still around. I opted to get a slice of mango cake, with sweet mango topping a white cake and mango puree topping with cream between the layers.. I also got a slice of tiramisu, my favorite thing of all we ordered.  It had a strong cocoa smell from the cocoa powder topping, with whipped cream and white cake layers.  I also enjoyed the guava cheese strudel, but it was a bit heavy and too sweet.  I liked the coconut pastry with the dried sweet coconut paste inside the pastry.  The rolito pastry, rolled yellow cake with pastry, was decent but not as good as the other stuff.

Too bad we didn't taste the cakes. The ones we saw were beautiful, and if they tasted anything like they looked they would be perfect.  We don't plan to order any cakes soon, but this would definitely be a spot to order one.

Having recently ordered a cake for another event at another bakery and being pretty dissatisfied, I was really stressed about this cake order. Roly's came highly recommended from another Mommy friend of mine so I gave it a shot. 

The place isn't much to look at and I wouldn't describe the guy who took my cake order as super friendly but he listened to everything that I said. I had several photos of cakes from Pinterest and u was kind of combining them all to create the perfect cake for my little's perfect party. The guy was patient and took lots of notes. Then we got to flavors. They have tons to choose from and lots of fillings as well. We ordered a two tier cake (30 servings) so I got chocolate with raspberry filling for the top and Cuban cake (which he described as a very moist white cake) with Bavarian cream coconut filling. 

I braced myself for the cost: $172! This was extremely reasonable. So reasonable in fact that my neurotic brain started worrying about the quality of the cake. 

When I picked the cake up, it wasn't ready. We had about a 15 min wait which normally would not have bothered me but it was the morning of her party and I had tons to do so I was a little agitated. 

Any and all agitation immediately dissipated upon seeing the cake! It was PERFECT! Exactly what I asked for.  Driving the cake home was nerve wracking and next time I will definitely pay for delivery. 

The most important thing is this was also one of the best cakes I had ever tasted. Moist and cool with the perfect amount of evenly sweet frosting. I got several compliments from the parents and the kids devoured it!  My only regret was I didn't get to try the chocolate tier. I blinked and it was gone!

The staff has all their hair in place which is also a good sign. The desserts looked extremely appetizing. I decided to buy their beef pastry, sausage pastry, senorita, meringue, and tres leches. 

The beef and sausage were okay. The senorita was good but I couldn't get myself to eat it all. The crust it had was a bit hard to get through with a fork. The filling was good but the lack of other flavors other than the vanilla made me get bored of it quickly. The meringue was good too. I don't think anyone can mess that up.  The tres leches on the other hand was awful! It was just cake and milk mush with whip cream on top. It was gross! I always though tres leches should be a little dense. Oh well.

Cappucinno
Flan
Pan Con Croqueta - Ground Seasoned Ham Croquettes with Swiss Cheese Served on Toasted Bread

Located on East Tropicana Avenue and as such driven past thrice weekly en route to work it was largely an effect of location and ongoing intrigue that led me to Roly's Bakery on Saturday afternoon and opting for a small selection due to otherwise substantial eating plans my experience was fine, though certainly not without flaws.  Obviously a small space, and one not particularly easily identified from the street despite large billboards located down the street, it was just prior to 2:00pm that I entered the small Cuban bakery and with several folks seated and eating I took my time to peruse the options, a middle-age woman keeping a watchful eye on me until I was ready to go, my $10 order of one savory and three seats delivered to the table with a cup of water just five minutes thereafter.  Beginning first with the pork croquette sandwich, a pair of fried sticks filled with what I can best describe as 'pig puree' proving an acquired taste beneath tomatoes and Swiss cheese, I only ate one half before satisfying my curiosity and moving onward the guava-cream cheese pocket was indulged in similarly - a nice enough flavor, though most would find bottom of the wastebasket as I'd have simply preferred it more flaky and warm.  To this point largely underwhelmed it was onward to the meal's two best selections that I moved and although the 'cappucino' was two lovely bites of sponge cake rife with simple syrup it simply could not compare to the eggy custard flan, a world-class example with a lightly browned top and pockets of raisins amidst a sea of lightly sugared eggs.

Small, cozy, and pleasant in service Roly's is one of the few places where locals are able to indulge in Cuban baked goods, but with a limited selection and too much focus on 'everything to everyone' items like cr me br l e, cupcakes, and tiramisu I'd have rather see them focus on more esoteric specialties like Porto's in Los Angeles - the lack of several items, including the tres leches, in portions smaller than a full tray was particularly disappointing.",0,3,ABtCLFoIEH26T2Ij-FQjag,review,0

U-3ifL_Cq1LRzjb-OS0l2g,5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,2014-07-12,5,"I first visited Roly's Bakery two weeks ago with my husband. We stopped in for a pastry and coffee to follow up lunch at Cuba Cafe. 

Confession: We had a full meal with appetizers, sides, entrees, dessert, AND coffee at Cuba Cafe but, upon realizing Roly's was just down the street and on the way home, we decided to turn our cheat meal into a cheat life. I'm not ashamed. 

Though I was unable to eat again until the next day, I'm both glad we visited and sad we didn't know about this place sooner. 

My husband and I are recent transplants from LA where Cuban bakeries are abundant (Porto's and Cafe Tropical being two popular go-to's). I mention this because most of my experience with Roly's is best explained through comparisons from what I already know.

We ordered a guava cheese pastry, otherwise known as a pastel de guayaba con queso, and two espressos. 

The coffee: It's very easy to percolate a pot of Cuban coffee at home but it's so refreshing to have it done for you on a much cooler industrial percolator.  Based on the cups used, Gavina is the grounds of choice here. Within minutes, two steaming cups were brought to our table and we were directed to the counter for our sweeteners. My Cuban husband was disappointed to not have his coffee made with the characteristic sugar slurry but, at the same time, having the option of using non-sugar sweetener was nice (sidenote: on our second visit today, we were asked if we wanted sugar already mixed in, which my husband enthusiastically accepted).

The pastry: We were served a pastry that was still warm and crusty. It was absolutely delicious. Here's where the comparison comes in: while the price point is higher at just a bit over $1 per pastry, it was more than generously filled with guava paste and cream cheese. The ratio was just about perfect, which I cannot often say about the pastries at Porto's.

A quick scan of the cases and menu showed two things: cuban crackers and bread that we'd been missing all this time as well as breakfast served all day. The latter was what brought us back today. 

There are four combos available: 

#1: 2 eggs, toast (Cuban bread), and coffee for about $5

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rolys-bakery-las-vegas?select=ciUJhawXmWuJhpW8pjXxrw#ciUJhawXmWuJhpW8pjXxrw


#4: 2 eggs, toast (Cuban bread), marinated steak, pastry, and coffee for about $8 

To each combo, you can add ham, sausage, and other items for $1/each .

In addition, there are four omelette selections: western, spanish, veggie, and one other that escapes me. All come with a pastry and coffee. 

I ordered the #1 with fried eggs and added bacon. Now, at $1 extra for the bacon, I expected one or two small slices. What I got was THREE crispy thick slices. The eggs were fried perfectly to my liking. The toast? Well, what's there to complain about when you're given freshly buttered toasted Cuban bread?

My husband ordered the #3 with scrambled eggs and a guava pastry. First, it's clear the eggs used are real and not bagged. Second, my husband was thrilled to find that they're seasoned lightly with Sazon, a popular Latin seasoning blend that we use in his eggs at home. Now, the most important part. My husband loves croquettes but has learned not to expect much from any place that sells them. Today, that changed. He bit into his croquette expecting the usual mediocrity and, instead, his eyes lit up and he looked toward the kitchen said, ""Oh my god, MOM? ARE YOU IN THERE?"".

Anyway, I am Dominican and I was born and raised in Miami. Many of my friends growing up are Cuban.  To this day, when I go home to Miami my dad goes to Riviera Bakery on 17th ave to get me an assortment of pastelitos. So, I consider myself an honorary Cuban pastry connoisseur.  With that said, I will say that Roly's is pretty good, for Vegas. 
I've had the pastelittos (pastries) - cheese, guava, guava with cheese and meat. All good, but not as flaky and yummy as I am used to. 
I've had the croquettes, and they are okay as well. 
I had a mango milkshake and a mamay milkshake and they were both good.  
Can't go wrong with a cafe con leche.  
So here's the deal.  If you're expecting authentic ""from back home"" stuff, then you're going to be disappointed.  But, if you just need a little fast of home to get you through the day, week or months, then you'll be okay.  They do a good job and trying to make everything truly as Cuban as possible and you have to give credit where it's due.  And if there are Cubans in there on a regular basis drinking coffee and eating sandwiches, then it's gotta have some authenticity to it.

I do usually choose B&N, but I think I liked the Borders experience better in this location. Firstly, it's a little bit easier to approach/find parking for than the B&N (when coming from 90, it's a quick right on Detroit, then left into the parking lot, as opposed to weaving in and out of Crocker Park ""streets""). It's right next to the movie theater and Spoon Me, two of the main reasons I have to visit Crocker Park (the other being Liquid Planet, but I think Spoon Me trumps that one as well).

Also, I like the layout of this Borders. They have a nice kids' section and a much larger parenting/education section than the Barnes and Noble (yes, I suppose since I'm a mom now, I have to take these things into consideration). 

Checkout took exactly 30 seconds.

I bought their $5 for $9 Worth of Hot Pressed Wraps or Panini Sandwiches deal and made my way over, excited to give them a second try since the last time I'd been here, they were still rather new. 

The place was empty when I walked in. A waitress was standing there looking at me like I was a freaking alien, so I cheerily said ""Hi there!"" to HER. I said it to HER. She kept staring. I told her I'd gotten a Groupon Now deal as I went to sit at the bar. She nodded, but looked completely flustered and finally grabbed a menu for me and asked ""This is To Go?"" in a way that pushed me to say yes, even though I was expecting to eat there. She stood right in front of me while I was trying to figure out what to order while tapping her pen on the counter, making me feel rushed. 

I had planned on getting a panini, so I looked at the paninis (the menu has changed significantly since we'd been there) and quickly saw that NO panini was $9. They're either $10 or $11. uhhhhhh okay. So I looked through the wraps. They were all $6-8, so whatever. I'll lose my extra $1 in savings. No big deal, so I order an $8 wrap called Popeye something or other, trying not to think about how it seemed a little sneaky to offer a deal for something that forces you to pay more or save less once you get there.

The waitress puts my order in their system and I give her my phone with the Groupon code pulled up. She writes down the information and she hands me my phone back and I hold onto it for a little while until she walks away and then I hit the ""redeemed"" button. She came back from the kitchen area looking even more confused and flustered than before. She needed to look at the code again because it wasn't going in the system. I tell her that it can't be pulled up after it's been redeemed, but I can try? So I do and show her that the code is gone. She huffs and paces and taps her pen against the bar some more, making me feel really uncomfortable, until she finally goes to the back again and time passes. When she comes back, our conversation goes like this:

Waitress: ""Oh my boss figured out why it wasn't working."" 
Natalie G: ""Oh, okay that's good!"" 
W: ""It's because the Groupon is for a PANINI, not a wrap. When they put up the Groupon, it's not supposed to say wrap. So since you got a wrap, it's $8, not $9 like the Groupon says and that's for a panini"" 
NG: ""..............Come again?""
W: ""You have to pay $8 for the wrap"" 
NG:""I have to pay $8 on top of the $5 from the Groupon? There aren't even any paninis that cost $9. And the Groupon says wrap... I don't think I understand why I would be paying extra."" 
W: *huff huff pace pace tap tap pace huff*

I finally tell her I want to speak to her boss or manager or whoever is back there and so she disappears again. When she came back, she hands me my food and just offhandedly tells me that ""It was taken care of.""

YEAH IT WAS TAKEN CARE OF. Where is my apology? Where was the manager? Why is this even an issue? Does the waitress know customer service at all? Good luck, Mumbles. I don't know how you survived this long.",2,1,0QiXMQroT9V6ByBLehufgw,review,2

Try a Long Island Louie.  Better yet, check out the hot-pressed tortillas.

I had the Mumbles Crumbles with shaved beef, tomatoes, onions, peppers, and a blue cheese sauce.  Great!

I don't know if this is ""true"" New York pizza, but it's certainly a departure from the national chains.  Not thick crust, but not crispy thin either, and just the right amount of good sauce.  I personally would like a bit more cheese - but my friends think it's perfect just as is.  The sausage and pepperoni are better than what I've had on other pies delivered locally.

This pizza is great fresh and hot, but is just as good two hours later when there's a break in the action in the Friday night poker game.  The perfect food for weekends!

The menu says they offer wings and chicken fingers too - maybe someday we'll branch out from a stack of pizzas on a Friday night.  The specialty pizzas, calzones and strombolis sound incredible.

SXhLbS9v3Nok7kT5MQhovg,v2WrKPkRI1TikXDKAi8VFw,2011-04-18,1,"Last Friday, 4/15/11, my family and I went to City Buffet as we had been there before on a number of occasions and liked the food.  We were especially partial to City Buffet since their promotional prices and coupons made their buffet a pretty good deal.  So on Thursday afternoon, I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager who told me that they accepted ALL COMPETITORS' coupons as well as their own expired ones (as they advertised).  I also inquired about the pricing and was told that the pricing was still $13.99 for dinner on weekdays and $14.99 for the weekends.  I was also told that they offered take out service by the pound which was $5.99 per pound without seafood and $8.99 per pound for their seafood take-out.  
 
We got there and were extremely disappointed and angry:
* First of all, after we ate, we were told that they did not accept competitors' coupons, in direct contradiction to what the manager told me;
* Their crab legs, braised lobster dishes were very slow to be refilled.  All the other people there were grumbling about this too;
* They did not have the fried, cracked crab and the Dungeness crab as they advertised;
* And they raised the prices on Thursday nite. Why wasn't I told that when I called on Thursday afternoon?
* Further, they did not have a take-out option by the pound.  They charged me the full dinner price for a little container of food that I took for my other daughter who was at home.

I expected the prices to go up or the menu items to diminished since I suspected that their pricing and their menu offerings were ""introductory"" in nature, but the thing that pisses me off if the use of deception, lying, and false advertising.  The honest provider would publish new prices and new menus and would not give people false information over the phone.

I just drove by the place on my way in to work this morning and the big advertising banners are still up at the restaurant with the false pricing and false menu items.

Fuw6Aqacfl5Np4abNK0tzw,GtY92e_A39HpCW8LF9pnTw,2011-01-16,0,"This place used to be called Jen Buffet. They're now under the dubious ownership of City Buffet, though the chef is still the same (for now).

Seriously underrated. I'm Chinese, so naturally, I love buffets. Still, I find most of the offerings in Arizona to be lackluster if not downright disgusting. In terms of seafood, the quality at Jen Buffet (or City Buffet, as it's called now) is fresher than even Pacific Buffet, specifically the sushi/sashimi and the shrimp. The grilled fish is also really fresh. There are less items than Pacific Buffet, but the quality is generally better. Here's the run-down of my experience.

Day of the Week: Saturday Night

People: Generally empty--there was one family speaking Cantonese seated near us, but mostly non-Asian diners

What I ate (at least, what I could remember):
Tuna and Salmon sashimi--fresh if small-portioned
Various sushi items--typical California roll, Philly roll, spicy tuna--fresh and tasty
Seaweed salad--too salty
Octopus--too salty
Mussels--chewy and fairly fresh
Oysters--clean oyster taste, though my brother complained his was bitter and had sand in it
Crayfish: Cantonese family swooped down on these as soon as they refilled the tray; did not get to try these
Clams: fresh and tasty!!!!!
Roast Beef: My piece was a bit tough/overdone in texture, but the flavor was good
Coconut Shrimp: The one Americanized Chinese dish I'll admit to actually liking--a bit soggy, but again, the flavor was good
Stuffed Chicken: surprisingly good; the outside was crispy and the inside with thick and juicy
teriyaki chicken: nice sweet/savory glaze and juicy, tender chicken inside
Mongo BBQ: light and not overly sauced
hot and sour: I have low tolerance for spiciness, so I thought it was a bit too spicy--my mom loved it
custard bun: small and delicate--possibly the BEST custard buns I've eaten at a Chinese buffet. Not soggy and not dry--the PERFECT dim-sum quality texture
banana ""pudding"" (in squares): silky smooth, cool, and delicious
unlabeled dessert that tasted like banana pudding with a tasty base of banana cake and bananas--it had the ""fake"" artificial banana flavor that my brother really enjoys
unlabeled soft-serve ""ice cream"" that I strongly suspect was actually frozen yogurt--not watery, but a bit icy as frozen yogurt often is. I loved it, though, being lactose-intolerant and all
cantaloupe-fresh!!!! It was actually FRESH!!!!! Oh, the joy of finding fresh fruit at a Chinese buffet

Missing food (that is, what Pacific Buffet has that this place doesn't)

-Crab legs: my mom said they used to have these, but Chinese families would grab 5-6 plates of crabs legs per person, in order to get their money's worth. Personally, I've always found crab legs at buffets to be bland and uninspired
-Pineapple RIce
-Red bean paste bun shaped like a peach
-More sashimi/sushi offerings
-frog legs
-hard scoop ice cream (green tea amongst other flavors)
-sweet dessert soup (with white fungus, gingko nuts, and dates/longan)
-BBQ pork buns (actually it might have been Phoenix Palace that used to have this way back when it was a buffet)

Price: $9.99+tax. Best deal EVER.

For the value, City Buffet has the freshest seafood in town. Almost everything was authentic (no overly sauced, greasy, ""spicy"" Americanized Chinese food here) and that might be the problem. Chinese people like authentic Chinese food, but they would never go to a buffet unless it had expensive items like crab legs and sashimi--otherwise, they can just prepare it at home. I'm afraid this hidden gem might close down or worse, descend to the depths of bad American Chinese. And there's far too much of that already.

Honestly, I'm not even a picky eater. Even though I am Chinese, I would not say I'm a Chinese food snob. I firmly believe that amazing Chinese food and dim sum can be found outside of San Francisco and yes, even in buffets. I love myself a good Chinese buffet and have been to much better ones.

BUT, this place is just bad

As a disclaimer, I do not eat seafood, so it was partly my fault for coming here. I can't comment on those dishes, but I can't imagine them being very good based on the other dishes

I started with noodle bowl station. This is really what convinced me to stay here since I love noodles. Well, the wonton were tiny and bland, while it seemed like they put three noodles in the bowl with a huge amount of broth. The beef stew noodle was also lacking in the amount of noodles and the noodles were still clumped up. The beef was so tough, and there were 7 or 8 pieces of anise in the bowl. Too much.

The mongolian grill was next as I figured, this will be better since I can choose my own stuff. NOPE. There was hardly any flavoring in the stirfry, the meats were awful quality, and no sauces really to flavor it all.

They have standard ""Chinese"" buffet fare like beef broccoli, spring rolls and orange chicken, in addition to some dim sum. The dim sum buns were hard and these dishes just tasted unappetizing. Blah. The spring roll was especially offensive. The only thing that I enjoyed were the fried wings, which I stuck to after discovering everything else was not good.

after being told we couldn't order food in hyde out (for reasons unknown to us as the cook was clearly making food in the kitchen) we headed to the next closest option and lucky for us it was this zizzi.  we we first came in the waiter that greeted us seemed a bit put out that there were eight of us for a table without reservations (although they were only moderately busy with empty tables available).  luckily for us the guy set a table anyway and we were shown to it with our drink orders taken by a lovely and friendly waitress.

i really have to compliment the waitress on her service for us.  she was lovely and polite and helpful the entire time, checking on us after the food arrived but not constantly being around or disappearing for long lengths of time.  after such poor service at hyde out i was really pleased that this girl was so attentive and friendly, well done to zizzi for hiring her!

the food was also very lovely.  we had an assortment of garlic breads to start, my favourite being the tomato with pesto although the garlic bread with cheese was also quite tasty.  i had a rustica pizza for my main with auberinge, rocket, olives, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms (which i'd subsituted for the peppers) drizzled with pesto.  it was awesome!! and the perfect thing to line my tummy for the drinks to come in the night ahead.  i also shared a really lovely sauvigon blanc that was fruity and fresh and so enjoyable :)

so yes a chain restuarant, but this place had good quality food and good service.    it's a bit of a shame that it's tucked away behind cargo but this didn't seem to stop people from finding it.  so well done zizzi for proving that chain restaurants can also provide a lovely and tasty meal.",1,4,HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw,review,0

This area was developed relatively recently, and befits the fashionable image that people would now associate with the Fountainbridge area of Edinburgh.  The building that houses the restaurant is primarily glass in construction, and this affords diners a great view of the canal basin and the moored boats.

The food is particularly good.  Prices are comparable to its competitors, and the quality of the food is great.  I was there as part of a large group, and never at one point did I feel that anything was taking too long, or did I impatiently have to catch the eye of the waiting staff.  The kitchen feels like part of the restaurant, and if you're looking hard enough, you can actually see your meal coming together.

What was best about this place was the price - it's really reasonable for what you get. The selection of wine is good, as is the selection of other drinks.
If it's a warm day (or if you're wearing a woolly hat) you can sit outside on the terrace and enjoy the view of the canal basin.
There are a couple of good bars close by for a drink after dinner and of course there's a couple of cinemas along the road for a film before or after your meal.",0,4,HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw,review,0

The view is lovely out in to the harbour however we were seated to the back because it's so busy (which was a good sign) casual atmosphere (staff wearing jeans and uniformed top) Had never been to this particular Italian chain before and so was unsure of what to expect; ordered the dough sticks to share as starter, ideal as its actually quite a large portion which is nice, would have preffered butter as opposed to the mayonaise but other than that it was a good start. Ordered the house wine which wasn't the best but fairly cheap at  3.00 glass.main course however was not satisfactory at all; chicken and mushroom pasta bake, pretty sure the sauce was either dated or from a tin, very similar to the consistency of soup! Also couldnt eat it for the first five minutes as it was too hot from having been in the oven. Friend ordered the meat calazone, dough was lovely and thick however the whole meal was really hot (spicey)...perhaps better suited to those with a liking for spicey food- jalapenos in every forkful! Over all i would say the service was good, and if you are looking for a basic meal before cinema like myself it is ideal, not sure i personally would go back though",0,2,HV63uIMuUEcta9uMpJgMgw,review,0

Located in a large strip mall right on the corner. Look for a place with a banner and several colorful posters of the food specials in each window.

They have Fish, Oysters, Shrimp, Chicken, Burgers, Philly Cheese Steaks and more. You can even order a Salad and load it up with with some of the proteins mentioned above. They also have several fried appetizers as well as some really good side dishes. The Coleslaw is really good and taste like my recipe. Great value and large portions.

Really like the Catfish and Shrimp. You can get them fried or grilled. The fried Oyster plate is also very tasty and a favorite of mine. You definitely have to try the Catfish, Shrimp or Oyster Po-Boys. Reminds me of what we used to get when we would stop at these tiny roadside shacks while traveling along the gulf coast in LA and MS.

It had no real favor in the cornmeal it had a little salt but no real favor.

I really loved the tarter sauce. It was unique and very good.

Very quiet on a Sunday night which could be off putting but we received a warm greeting and so we got comfortable. 
The menu seemed just right- standard Thai fare with some nice pictures and clever descriptions-- we were drawn to several dishes. We had the crispy spring rolls and mango salad for starters. Then we shared the pad Thai (very good- my friend who was craving it after years away in Italy declared)- light and well flavoured, not heavy or gummy. Also had a very flavourful red curry chicken. Just coconutty enough and quite spicy!  Cashew chicken and ginger beef (not crispy if that's maybe what you are expecting) rounded out the dishes and a big bowl of rice for the table. We were 3 people and had very few leftovers bc everything was so tasty. 
And the service was lovely. Attentive (lots of water refills) but not intrusive.

I might not have found this place without a tip from a coworker that lives in the area, and it turns out another coworkers brother owns it! So with those two recommendations, and a date at the Queensway VIP, it was an easy choice. 

The place is small, with two booths and a few tables. Based on the number of people coming in for takeout, I imagine that's a popular aspect of the place. 

We started with two apps, the fresh rolls and chicken crispy spring rolls. Both were delicious and fortunately the fresh rolls came out super quickly because I was starving! So starving that when the spring rolls came out I forgot to take a picture. Whoops. I then tasted three of the entrees, my own was the beef pad sew which was AWESOME - not light on the beef at all and the cut of meat was a higher quality than I was expecting. Yum! I also tried the curried up pad Thai and Tom yum noodles. Both were excellent! 

We were lucky enough to enjoy a banana fritter on the house which was also excellent! 

One more about the place is that there's no liquor license, which was sad because I wanted a beer! That's probably due to the takeout nature of the restaurant, and I survived. Lucky they serve alcohol at the movies.

Firstly, I will say that as a small business owner myself, service to the customer and making sure the customer leaves your business happy is paramount and unfortunately, neither the food or the business ethic has left a good taste in my mouth.

As Mangosteens is new and very close to my home, I ordered their Famous Pad Thai some Spring Rolls and Mango Sticky Rice through Orderit.ca. As a lover of spicy foods, I added a comment for it to be hot and spicy just out of past experience with every other Thai restaurant I have eaten at. Well ... I am not about to blame Mango for the 35 dollar price tag to get this single order 2 minutes down the road to my house .. BUT .. The next few hours proved to be an heated experience that I wouldn't wish upon anyone. 2 Litres of water didn't even get me through half the Pad Thai. It was fine with my friends to laugh at my attempts to eat this Noodle INFERNO but I had to stop. I don't need to expand on the extreme pains keeping me up from 4 am to 6:30 that night.

The next day I wrote to their website and after no reply I went to their restaurant and simply asked them to give me another Pad Thai without the ridiculous heat. They said they couldn't but they would have the Manager call me. .. They didn't call. 

I have just got home after a return trip to Mangos and after a lengthy chat with the Manager that included some drivel about ""Racial Profiling"" when I mentioned I never had such heat in a dish from other establishments, their reply was that restaurants would tone down the heat for people like myself. LOL .. OK ... So when you deliver to strangers via take out, you turn the heat back up? I asked myself. .. Here was someone willing to give their restaurant another chance to redeem themselves and I'm in a verbal volley over a 12 dollar dish!

My theory after they offered me 50% off, was to waive them of my business and to vent a little here. I'm sure their food might be very good but there is a Thai restaurant across the street. If just one person reads this and agrees that for the sake of future business with a customer is to make them happy rather then bicker about semantics then that is a 12 dollar expense they should have bared.

When you go inside, you're not really sure what the deal is.  It's half cafe, half bar.  On one end you have a cafe with cakes and cafe tables; on the other end you have a stage for a band and a pool table.  Weird.

Oh, did I mention that the place is also filthy?  I'm not really a big stickler for a really clean restaurant or sparkling floors but a pair of spring rolls and some napkins underneath my feat is going a bit far.  Maybe that was the appetizer?

To give it to them, a 5.99 daily special is pretty enticing, that's what I ordered.  It was a plate of jerk chicken with coleslaw and rice & peas.  It also came with a soft drink of your choice.  It was a pretty good deal in my mind.

The chicken was dry and not really flavourful... I'd almost put it on par with chicken from metro that had been sitting out for a while.  That's about what it tasted like.  Same thing with the rice and peas.  Not exactly the best thing in the world; in fact, far from it.

Being in a plaza with pretty strong contenders, this place isn't going to win anyone over at this rate.  If you want to have some jamaican food, drive 2 minutes down the block and you'll get something way better.",2,1,AeIO-BNccGmNpikIj95Dig,review,3
jasG9nOlGSKMPnPcCOVKJg,i3S4pxmcggTzfyewIKTn6Q,2013-08-22,2,"I went here at the request of my boyfriend for take-away, he was really in the mood for some good Caribbean food and it sounded like a good idea to me.
The place was easy enough to find considering I'd never been there before, and the service was decent.  Not overly friendly, but I was acknowledged.
Walking in I noticed how different this place was set up to other restaurants, as they had a little cafe-type area to the left, and a pool table/stage in front/to the right.  The whole place was very bright and clean, and had music playing softly in the background.  I didn't realize until I was leaving that it was gospel music; which in hindsight makes sense considering the restaurant name.

I ordered the large jerk entree, chicken fingers and fries, and the slushie special.  The slushie was a pina colada flavour, about 16oz for $1.00, and it tasted AMAZING.  After finishing it, I wished I had gotten another for myself before leaving the store.  The chicken fingers and fries to be honest, were horrible.  They tasted worse than something I would have ruined at home.  The chicken was the same kind as nuggets from a slimy fast food chain or low-cost frozen nuggets, and the fries were unseasoned.  For $7.99, I was extremely unimpressed. 
The jerk entree my boyfriend ordered looked fantastic.  It was a huge portion (4 hefty sized legs) tons of rice and peas, with a spicy coleslaw.  I tried some of his meal, and while the jerk was too spicy for my taste everything was cooked wonderfully.  His $8.99 was hands-down worth the price, and made my meal seem worse by comparison.  He was able to eat his portion for three separate meals (lunch, dinner, lunch the following day).  My meal,  I tried eating what was left for lunch the following day, and I got about 4-bites in before I started feeling extremely sick.

Overall I would definitely go back to this place, but I would steer clear of the ""American"" dishes, as I feel the love and attention is more placed into the Caribbean-style dishes.
Also: if you are sensitive to spicy food, avoid the jerk and go for the fried chicken instead.  I assume it would be just as nicely cooked, only without the spice ;-)",0,4,AeIO-BNccGmNpikIj95Dig,review,0

Very nice place and location with plenty of parking. The menu seemed endless and yet some of the things were odd to us.

Someone needs to remember to NOT pour runny salsa over tortilla chips if serving as ""nachos"". Other than that, the pricing was fair and comparable to other places. Not my favorite but I'd probably go back.
Our server, Eden, was awesome and had a thick Scottish accent. Very nice and affable but I literally had to ask her to slow down when speaking because of the loud atmosphere in the restaurant.

It's kind of tucked away, so it'd be easy to walk right by and not notice it at all, but its worth stopping for a bite to eat if you want something ""healthy"". Beware: this is not the place to go if you're in a rush, unless you pick up one of the ready to go meals that are in the fridge. They tend to take their time making things (all wraps and sandwiches go in the panini press, which adds to the wait time) but they make it fresh in front of you. It's a trade off I suppose!

While not everything on their menu classifies as ""healthy"" (an 800 calorie wrap for one meal doesn't really work for me) I've gone to both locations numerous times, for breakfast and lunch and have had generally pleasant experiences every time. 

If you want a quick cheap breakfast they  have a number of ""toonie"" options in the morning, including a grilled cheese. But beware - I got one of these so called $2 breakfasts and by the time I was done, it cost me $5 - but that's because I added bacon and tomato and they never told me how much extra it was (given, I could barely understand the girl but that's my own fault for not clarifying). If you want to pay a toonie, stick with the basics. I'll add that I don't eat a lot for breakfast usually and not eating breakfast at home is rare, so the small grilled cheese sandwich (plain the second time) was enough to get me through the morning til lunch but my male coworker, who values quantity, complained about how small it was. The full blown grilled cheese with bacon and tomato WAS a great option for the ""feeling iffy morning-after-a-night-of-drinking "".

The veggie wrap is rather nice - for something without meat in it, its a filling but light-feeling meal. Also, not too much sauce or stuffing, just the right amount. The Turkey Bacon club is yummy but its also rather large. I have a hard time finishing the entire sandwich and usually someone at work finishes the other half for me.

For a place that claims to be healthy, they've only recently added nutritional information to their website and I was a bit put off by some of the values they had for my favourite meals.

When we called to place the order, the employee seemed like he was in ten different places at once. Very spacey. After telling him what we wanted, he responded with ""Okay. That'll be $25 and will be there in 40 minutes."" He didn't even ask us how we were paying. Since we wanted to pay with a card, we called right back to give them the card information. The employee once again seemed like he had no clue what was going on and thought we were calling to add on to the order. He didn't understand we just needed to give the card information. It was pretty frustrating.

They do tack on a $2.00 delivery fee which many other places do not charge. The selection is pretty standard for the area. Most of the pizza joints in 15210 are pretty much the same. This place is a step or two below the rest, unfortunately.

We got a medium pepperoni pizza and a small capiccola hoagie. The hoagie was great. Crispy, crunchy bread. A good hefty portion of spiced ham. I asked for banana peppers and they were quite liberal with those. The hoagie was quite nice...and again pretty standard for the area.

The pizza wasn't too great. The crust was nice and crispy, big plus. There was alot of cheese on it....salty, oil and nutty. The only complaint was the sauce...which tasted like canned tomato sauce...no spices or nothing. It was tart and very basic...very bland. Normally I don't fret so much over the sauce as long as the crust is spot on...but they slathered on way too much sauce and it kinda just killed the pizza for me.

The price for a medium 1 topping pizza and a half hoagie plus delivery fee was $18.01...like I said quite pricy for the area. They had a bunch of coupons for specials where we have gotten like twice as much food for just a couple bucks more....but we didn't need a whole hoagie and a large pizza...it woulda been a waste.

All in all...this place is just a little below average. We had the pizza before and we remembered it not being all that great. This second time confirmed this. The hoagies are good though, but plenty of other places in the area have hoagies just as good. The $2.00 delivery fee is a real downer, though.",1,2,9HD224rVyahrfg9SNe5SVg,review,1

The menu is made up of dozens of little dishes that are cheap enough to order by the handful.  When I was there with family, my father-in-law said, ""I've always wanted to order one of everything on a menu.  I can do that here!""  He was pretty excited.

While I would say that little on the Mezzetta menu stands out as extraordinary, it's all very good and the experience is what makes it great.  Dishes of note:  Anything with eggplant is excellent, veggie vine leaves are lemony and good - although a bit mushy, sultan's stew is terrific, roasted peppers and the green beans are divine, falafels are crispy and flavourful.  I haven't tried any of the meat dishes, but they look good on other people's tables.  Fried yams are lacking in crispness and the houmous is lacking in lemon (go for the baba gannoush instead!) but for only a few dollars a dish, you can afford to experiment.

Service is excellent.  True story: my brother-in-law and his girlfriend were there the other day and, it being Passover, couldn't eat the pita bread.  Without a word, the server whisked away the bread and replaced it with whole wheat matzah.  So kind!

You read that right.  If I had to choose one top restaurant, it would be Mezzetta.

I love the concept.  There are some 50 items on the menu and something for everyone.  It is a lot of fun, especially with a small group, to talk and negotiate what you'll order.  The small plates allow you to get many tastes all in one night.  It is the ultimate restaurant for anyone with commitment issues!

The food itself is delicious.  I don't think I have tried one of the dishes that wasn't pretty tasty--and many are really good, even the basics such as the rice.

The service has always been good too; I have never had a problem with slow service or the like.

The value is fair--if you want to stuff yourself silly and spend as little as possible, this is not your place.  But if you are looking for an interesting dining experience where you won't leave hungry or with an empty wallet, this IS your place.

The place can get a little bit crowded depending on the night and time.  I would recommend a reservation.  I have not been here for the music night.  I think it used to be jazz.

They can accommodate a larger party but the ideal size is probably 4 which allows you to sample 20 of the items.  A bigger party means more items but remember that the size of the plates stay the same--hence, people might not get to try everything.

I think one of the best times to come here is ""first date"" night, meaning the first proper date after you've met somebody for coffee or a drink.  Talking about the menu items can break any remaining ice and sharing the plates helps build a bond.  Plus you can then go for a walk along St. Clair.

The food was a solid ""good, not great.""  Some plates were definitely more memorable than others. I enjoyed the lamb shish and kofta (five stars on both of those), but the dips were less memorable. The dish that we didn't like was the eggplant garlic dip (we eat everything, I love eggplant and garlic, and was a bit surprised to not enjoy this), mostly because of the strength of the vinegar and the combo of mint and dill - not my thing

4 of us ventured in and ordered away, who could really go wrong with $1.50/every other dish? They brought the dishes in a bit of a strange order with some meat dishes coming before the salads, and then 15 mins would pass and another salad would come.... This caused us to loose track a bit of what we ordered, and how much was on the way. Needless to say we got too much and were pretty stuffed, yet walked away with a small meals worth of leftovers.

We somehow spent $94 with tax and tip altogether, which was a bit of a surprise but I guess even with the discount it adds up...especially when you loose track. 

I walked out feeling like I could chase away any vampire within a 5-mile radius. Also my stomach felt dense and a bit oily from the heavy use of olive oils in a lot of their dishes.

Who I am kidding? This restaurant is great. In fact, I have been recommending this Mediterranean and Tapas restaurant to close friends for years. It is cozy, on the medium/small size which actually adds to the vibe of homeyness, without ever being tacky. 

Of course, the highlight is the food: Generally light, tasty, varied, healthy, well priced and although I have never gone on their Loonie and Toonie days, it really seems like I should drop by and check them out!

Personally, I am a huge fan of tapas but generally find most restaurants in Toronto warp the recipe by giving you overpriced or undersized offerings in the $7 range, and although tapas may be small in size, they are supposed to be inexpensive since half the fun comes out of tasting a varied selection. In Spain, tapas can be as inexpensive as .99 cents of a Euro and in a lot of bodegas give you selected number of them for free. I do not expect that here but at the very least, I would prefer they stick to the spirit of the dish(!) and Mezzeta does that.  

Also, FYI, they now have music night, sure there is a $8 covers but really, I can't see how adding live music to your dinner experience could go wrong. 

A great place for a date and also to visit with friends, it is a very amiable and malleable location which easy suits different occasions.

*Houmous - puree of chick peas with tahina and lemon, and a secret blend of spices - A OK with the pita bread

*Eggplant Garlic A bold puree of flame-roasted eggplant, garlic, dill, mint, and vinegar

*Fried Yams - Crispy deep-fried yam chips, dressed with fried onion shavings - Yam! Yum! Giulana witnessed me ate the whole order by myself!

*Potatoe Sambousak -  Potato and onion puree wrapped in puff pastry, three pieces dressed with mezziki - brownish looking.. too bad those are not mini chocolate cakes.. dry and uninspiring!

*Exotic Green Beans - Crisp-fried green beans, shaved onion, dill and garlic, dressed spicy hot - not spicy hot at all! But the beans were cooked well, crunchy and fresh! My fave of the night!

*Mushrooms - Tender saut ed button mushrooms served in a garlic vinaigrette - standard, ok but not too exciting!

Not Sharing: (But I made them share with me)

*Kofta - spiced minced beef balls served in a rich tomatoe sauce - Not bad, but not really outstanding..
 
*Dream Sausage -  Flame-grilled beef-lamb sausage, spiced with herbed hot sauce (Stole from Tony F) MEH.. too lamby!

*Fish Shish -  Tasty, marinated marlin or swordfish, flame-grilled, 2 skewers (Stole from Giulana B) - GREAT! light and refreshing with a hint of lemon

*Lamb Shish - Savoury chunks of marinated lamb leg, flame-grilled, 2 skewers (Stole from Tony F) - Surprised that I like it! Rich flavour without lamby taste
 
*Vine Leaves -  Herbed minced beef and spiced Basmati rice wrapped in vine leaves and dressed with garlic yogourt and dill (Stole from Giulana) - hey I have no idea I should eat the leaves.. Chinese don't eat the leaves we used that as a wrapping!

*Chicken Shish -  Delicate, juicy marinated chicken breast, flame-grilled - A-OK, but not really memorable!

However once we arrived and I explained the concept of the menu (many small dishes, reasonably priced) they were all able to find multiple items that they enjoyed a great deal.

Service was prompt, the space is comfortable and warmly Mediterranean. From a cost-perspective Mezzetta is a great deal (more-so on Monday and Tuesdays when dishes are discounted). The food itself was great - wonderful flavors, fresh and served nicely.

My boyfriend does Meatless Monday and we had an errand to do nearby, so I suggested Mezzetta based on those endorsements & my long-time intention to visit. When we arrived we discovered that on Monday every 2nd dish up to 15 items costs $1.42 (every Tuesday Every ""mezze"" dish is $2.42, limit of 25 per party). The regular price of each food item on the menu is $3.50. Way to do Meatless Monday!

We ordered about a dozen dishes. The quality was amazing. We enjoyed all of it. Some standouts: I forgot how good falafel could be and then I had theirs. It was some of the best falafel I've had in Toronto, and among the best I've had outside Israel.  Crispy outside, soft and fluffy inside, spiced just right. The smokiness of the baba gannoush was exactly what I like in that dip. The Sultan's Stew, an ""exotic stew of saut ed and spiced eggplant, zuccini, tomato, green and red bell peppers, and onion"", made my mouth happy. The Red Goat salad (""goat"" being the feta cheese) tasted really fresh. 
My least favourite was one of the 2 meat dishes that we ordered (he bent on ""Meatless Monday""): The moussaka. 

Service: Friendly and fast.
Value: Fantastic (though remember, we went on Monday when the most expensive thing we ordered was a pitcher of lemonade).

My boyfriend wants to make it our regular Monday evening destination. I can't argue with that. While I might order some meat items - some chicken or lamb shish, perhaps -  I'm happy to stick with the many vegetable offerings.

The baba ghanouj, it had an interesting smoky taste. We also had green beans, hummus and sultans stew which were all delicious.  The mixed greens salad was even surprisingly good with a tasty vinaigrette and chopped walnuts on top.

They seem to forget that cumin, garlic, salt, pepper, and other spices are used for middle eastern cooking. The flash green beans, which I thought was a Chinese dish was horrible. This is favorite food of our waitress.

The falafel was sticky and raw, the baba ganoush flavorless, the pita bread was served cold, the hummus was too thick and flavorless, the hot sauce was disgusting,  mistake, the stuffed phyllo with a sauce of some sort was not pyllo dough and tasteless, the Mediterranean salad was bland. Although the water was very good.

ST-wbjTx6tbHzqYtINLcWg,sccPVgHWRAww1atzaOfOYQ,2013-04-29,12,"The pizza competition has a new challenger on Queen. Enter Enzo - I've no idea what their background is, but given that there's one Pizza Pizza down the street, two Pizzaiolos within a 5 min walk, and North Of Brooklyn (their direct competitor) immediately around the corner... let's just say it's a bold move.

On my way to pick up pizza for the team at NoBo, I dashed in to grab some from Enzo for a direct comparison.

I ordered both the Francesco (mushroom, mozz, olives, sausage, artichokes, roasted red) and Pepe (calabrese pepper, pepperoni, onion, olives). Flavour-wise, they sorta tasted the same, though I want to say I liked Pepe better. Both were decent picks, though I don't have a lot of recall on them - I was distracted by work. I'd probably give both a go again some time to check. Co-workers voiced that they liked North Of Brooklyn better (we also had NoBo's Margh and Puttanesca the same day).

But *I* clearly liked Enzo enough to return.

So, I had the Enza (buffalo mozz, fresh basil) today for lunch and really liked this one. The basil was nice and aromatic, the buffalo mozz was fresh and faintly buttery. Photo: https://twitter.com/foodpr0n/status/328945872253640704/photo/1

The crust: I like. On the thick side of thin and with good chew (more chewy than I think many people may like). The bake is just-toasty, and no significant charred bits. Gives it a nice (and even), crispy, outer shell. Taste of the dough is faintly sweet.

Overall, I like it. I feel the ingredients are good, the dough is tasty, and the cost is moderate (well, on the upper edges of that). Wasn't revelatory as that first bite of Libretto pizza years ago, but it's a good pie. Worth a try if you're in the area.",8,4,6DWFVwgm3d9jfBUOkJuANQ,review,0

Is it authentic? Not really. It's super greasy and the food tastes not-so-fresh. The portions are oversized to the point of being made for people with eating disorders. I didn't find much on the menu that was appealing to me. So I would not say it was made for my palette. 

The only thing I really liked was the free bread they bring out at the beginning of the meal. The music played throughout was also kind of cute. Like a 50's diner theme. No one else in the place seemed to notice or care.

All in all, overpriced junk food akin to what you'd get at a Denny's restaurant in the states. In UK lingo that would be the lowest denominator of a chain diner restaurant at a very bloated price tag. I know that most restaurants in the UK are priced for tourists, but I still think they should at least deliver quality to the price tag they're advertising. This one does not.

Oh, this place also refused to allow me to take home any leftovers in any form. Also a UK thing that I am aware is *somewhat* uncommon but it's not illegal and I do not see how hard it is to invest in some takeaway cartons for people to take home leftovers.

The soup base was alright and so were the noodles itself but the meat was in huge chunks. It was also pretty dry and tough so that made it hard to eat. I wish they could have made it more tender and served it as smaller pieces instead. Since the meat was like that, I assume they probably boiled the meat.

As other reviewers have said they barely give you any chips...I counted 7/8.

Skip the chain crap and visit Veracruz, conveniently located right between the Chipotle and the Q'Doba (and far better than anything either have to offer).  Pitt students, or anyone who looks like a student pretty much, even get a discount off the already low prices.

Portions are amply sized, and the burritos come in three different sizes unlike the horse-choker-fits-all style of the big chains.  Most of the best stuff on the menu isn't inside a burrito wrapper though, read over the whole menu and ask about any specials if you're unfamiliar, lots of good stuff to be had!

Plenty of hot sauce options on the table or the shelf, tasty imported sodas and juices to wash down your meal (including real homemade horchata) and if you're into either - you can always count on soccer or Hispanic soap operas (or both) being on the TV while you wait.",0,3,6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ,review,0

I got the chicken chili burrito and it was fine but not great and nothing particularly interesting about it.  It definitely did not taste authentic and there were no choices about what toppings or salsas to put in it.  I ordered a side of guac that was super tiny and it seemed fresh but had no flavor at all to it.  My 2 friends ordered a veggie burrito and a fish burrito, respectively but they switched them up and gave them the wrong orders.  Unfortunately my vegetarian friend didn't realize the mistake until he was several bites into the fish burrito and he was really upset after eating it and felt ill since he hasn't eaten meat in over 10 years.  Also the burritos are much smaller than what you get at Chipotle or Qdoba, even for their larger ""grande"" size and the prices are similar.  Also the tables were not very comfortable, there wasn't much seating, and the temperature inside was pretty cold on a Winter day.",0,2,6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ,review,0

Y_5sllxhABRbmSl4JhUPEQ,Yft76ogF5YzCQ4mn6vSQ6Q,2011-09-30,0,"Veracruz makes an effort to distinguish itself from the standard big burrito or Tex Mex chains, and these efforts  pay off.

Chorizo, barbacoa, and al pastor double wrapped tacos are now on the menu, as well as other authentic Mexican dishes like chilaquiles and sopes. Authentic Mexican food is a rare find in Oakland (let alone Pittsburgh), so these tasty dishes make Veracruz worth a visit. 

If you're unfamiliar with the aforementioned foods, I suggest you dive in and try them regardless of your personal reservations. Otherwise, Veracruz is simply average in terms of Americanized Mexican fare, such as nachos, quesadillas, and burritos. I actually prefer nearby Chipotle or Qdoba for Ameri-Mex. On a positive note, anything with their earthy, smoky chicken chili is decent, their guacamole is fresh and light, and their homemade red chili and avocado salsas are zesty and tasty.

Relatively cheap prices and a student discount is the icing on the cake (or the guac on the nachos, I guess). Service varies highly depending on who's taking your order.",0,4,6a4-SPP4QJbJuHoMhPKnVQ,review,0

The portions are pretty big - a grande quesadilla was almost too much for me to handle, and I was starving.  The sauteed veggies were a nice touch (black beans, onion & I think zucchini) but I would have liked a bit more cheese.  The Mexican rice was very authentic and took me right back to a little restaurant in Buenavista - pink, tasted of chicken stock, studded with peas.  The chips seemed a little stale and the salsa wasn't the greatest, but the entire meal (grande quesadilla with chips & salsa, side of rice, and a soda) was less than $7.
