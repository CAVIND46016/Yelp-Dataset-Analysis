I dropped a three dollar tip on that barmaid's ass. How could I not? A real meal at fast food prices, at fast food speed, served by someone not under house arrest with work privileges. Busted open the styro box. Big sandwich with mushrooms, onions, cheez and beef sliced so thin I swear it was a Steak'um. I never ate those as a kid, but I remember one time my friend had one in his bedroom where we were playing NES. He didn't want it, so we threw it all around the room. Fries were awesome.

Again, for the price, it was not worth. i can get thai green curry for $5.95 down the street and throw in some steamed lobster and get the same effect. \n\nhubby got korubuta pork chop. okay, but have had much better elsewhere.\n\nthe place is also really dark, to the point where you cannot read your menu. you have to put the menu an inch away from the candle on your table. lame.\n\nand the TI sirens show in the background is VERY annoying.\n\nskip this place. and TI, please don't make lame asian restaurants. it's an insult to the main demographic of your casino.", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "E5glLZ1mCo10-zqq3Bj13w"}

Service is pretty decent at the tempenyaki tables - soup, salad and the meal for one price (rice included) for one price and the servers are usually quick to bring out this portion. Tempenyaki takes a little bit of time - so do not come in here if you're in a rush - they usually wait to fill up the whole table with small parties... which by the way, is incredibly awkward! \n\nI'm sure there are better tempenyaki places in Montreal, but Toyo will make do.", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "segRkXhf1vSCnEi_aHnGdg"}

Luckily for us, this only took about 15 minutes, in which we had enough time to sample some of their tasty sake.\n\nOur chef was absolutely hilarious! He had a sort of Bruce Lee trying to do a joke type of humour and was a magician with his utensils. My colleague went for the scallops, while I opted for the filet mignon. Both were very tasty but the chef mentioned that I should try the samurai steak next time, as it's his personal favourite (he let me have a little bite and it was delicious).\n\nHalf way through the dinner, he asked us if anyone was celebrating anything special. We weren't there for anything in particular but my birthday was coming up that weekend so I told him I was turning 28. He surprised us with something spectacular (see the pic I posted!).\n\nWe really had a great evening here.

I understand that Nepali dishes aren't that different but to make the dishes taste the same is a bit ridiculous. They think that since no single table is going to order both the Nepali and Indian equivalents together, they can get away with making cosmetic changes to their dishes.\n\nWe ordered  Keema Samosas,  and the Nepalese Entrees: Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, lentils and bamboo shoots) and Khasi Ko Masu (goat meat with bone) and Ras Malai for dessert. The food was freshly prepared and piping hot. The Aloo Tama Bodi was quite bland and the Goat Meat curry tasted like generic Indian  goat curry. I was quite interested in the Aloo Tama Bodi primarily for the bamboo shoots and was saddened to see limp, noodl-y shoots in the bowl. Oh well. However, the Ras Malai was very good: delicately sweet, milky and cool.\n\nThe service was good except that they mixed up our order, but that was corrected in a jiffy.\n\nDinner for two came to about $ 52 with tip and tax.

Figured I'd stop in and have a quick bite and be on my way. \n\nWhen I walked in the door the first room was completely empty and there was a woman standing and staring at me. I turned to look at the sign and turned back around. She still said nothing. I asked if they were open and she said what did the sign say? I said it says open (but why the hell are you just staring at me like you are not). She finally says there is a large party coming in and to sit in the other room. I said sure. Both rooms are fairly small. The decor is pretty whack. Old office looking carpet and old booths. I'm a fan of tile in restaurants. Spilled food and drinks just don't come out of carpet and especially old office looking carpet. The tables are covered with that cheap vinyl red sticky covers that also never look or feel clean. The benches were old and had tears in them. There were 3 gentlemen in another booth and other than that the place was empty. \n\nWe were brought menus and drinks fairly quickly but no salsa. Another couple came in and sat down after us and were given chips and salsa immediately. Our waitress came back and asked if were ready to order. Still no chips and salsa. About 15 minutes into our \"quick\" lunch we were finally given a small bowl of chips and a couple of salsa. The salsa was ok. Nothing special. Same for the chips. We placed our orders and in comes out in about another 10-15 minutes. \n\nI had the El Conquistador burrito. Its a pretty large burro filled with a chile relleno, steak picado, and guac. It was ok. Really nothing good or bad. For 7.50 I expect greatness in a burrito. The wife had a bean and cheese burro w/ enchilada sauce. They were very tight on the sauce and cheese. It was the overall theme of the place. Very tight. For extra chips and salsa it was 1.50 according to the menu. \n\nThe waitress came by another 15-20 minutes later and asked how we were. I said we were ready to go now. She didn't take our plates and she didn't bring our bill. Another 5-10 minutes goes by and I finally get up and walk to the man at the front and ask him if could pay him directly. Our waitress, who's now talking on the phone, with our dirty plates still on our tables and check no where to be found even after I asked for it, makes a statement to the man that I am ready to go. No b, I was ready to go 20 minutes ago when I told you I was done. Now I'm ready for an apron cause I've been here long enough to get paid. \n\nFrom the conversations I heard the man and woman own the place. Good for them. I wont be back and don't recommend anyone else going back. I saw a newspaper article on the wall that AZcentral or New Times recommended it as a top 10 Mexican restaurant in town. Maybe it was good before they moved to this location. Maybe they lost some key staff members. Maybe they know something I don't.

They were on my radar of places to check out due to a reputation for craft beers and good food that I'd heard through a friend -- and, when they popped up as a Groupon, I jumped.  The menu and beerlist on their website really sealed the deal.\n\nI invited a couple other friends who had never been to come along, one of whom is a picky eater (and, after looking at the site, was excited), the other of whom, like me, is always looking to try new beers.\n\nSo we get to Local 4...  and it's a huge let down.\n\nThe food was mediocre to bad.  \n\nI had the bison spaghetti bolognese, which tasted as though they forgot to salt the water when cooking the noodles.  The sauce was ok, but there was precious little of it.  When I order a pasta dish at a restaurant and it's $14, I expect it to be something more than I can prep, at home, with little effort.  I wouldn't have been ashamed to serve it myself, but I certainly wouldn't have expected any particular compliments after the fact.\n\nSteak & Frites went to one friend, who's experience was similar to others here:  steak was dry, tough, bad.\n\nOther friend had the chicken cordon bleu -- she finished the chicken, which was decent (but again, nothing special), then left the potatoes and vegetables as unpalatable.  I was incredulous, so tried a few...  and she was right.\n\nBut the kicker was the beer list or, more appropriately, the lack of one.  They didn't have a single one of the craft beers we specifically came to try -- we ended up ordering some Blanche de Chambley (a personal fave, but not one I was hoping to \"try\"), then stuck with cocktails.  They didn't have MacAuslan (either apricot or stout), Black Oak, or Stonehammer (dark or light).  Are you kidding me?  You're touting your craft beers, and your selections are mostly imports, Sleemans, and a cider?  And what you do have are the most common, usual suspects: Mill St, Steamwhistle, and the like?  \n\nWe were bummed.  Add to this that the server had a rather uncaring attitude, was slow, and, when presenting the bill, just dumped it on the table.  Even forgot to factor in the Groupon, and seemed annoyed that I wanted him to adjust it.  (Now I feel like I'm ragging on the guy -- he seemed like a cool guy, just kind of out of his depth.)\n\nIn any case, I would hesitate giving a 1* rating to Local 4 if only because there's great potential there:  nice ambience, cool location, a menu that looks good on paper...  but they need to seriously re-evaluate what they're doing and their approach to food, drink, and service.\n\nJudging by recent reviews, they're certainly not watching review sites for what people are saying, and that's too bad.", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "8bKpyXdiYF3ZKIB3QyEiVQ"}

If you weren't a local, you probably wouldn't know it was here.  The decor is simple but modern and the servers are all very friendly.  The main colours of the restaurant are blue and red and the lighting creates a great ambiance, with lit candles lining the rear wall.  Upstairs houses 2 of its private dining areas which accommodate groups of 20-50 guests.     There is plenty of free street parking nearby - just one of the perks of being away from restaurants in the downtown core.\n\nThe menu has a good selection of Italian dishes.  I did fell however, that the entrées list was a bit small - especially if you weren't really up for pizza or pasta.\n\nThe house wine was courtesy of House Wine Co. featuring both the Red House (a blend of Shiraz and Cabarnet) and the White House (a blend of Riesling and Pinot Grigio).  These are both wines from the Niagara region, and I highly recommend them.  The server was even kind enough to bring over the bottle so we knew what it looked like before we head to the LCBO.  Wine purists may be scoffing at me, but I like hybrids!\n\nThe starter bread basket was warm, and probably one of the better breads I've had in Toronto.  For starters, it was warm.  It got a sprinkling of salted herbs and a dousing of balsamic vinegar.  It was hard not to devour the entire thing.  The bread was perfectly crusty as if it were fresh out of the oven.\n\nWe opted to share a Spinach Salad ($10) which was tossed with a halved egg, cherry tomatoes, red onion and shaved Parmesan cheese.  I found the leaves to have been awkwardly big, and the salad itself was pretty bland.  The saving grace were the freshly toasted walnuts.\n\nFor mains I opted for the meat special, a Peppercorn Striploin served with a generous portion of sweet potato fries (which I substituted in place of regular fries).  I loved that Chef Neil Siomra placed the steak on top of the bed of fries as the jus just trickled down and gave the fries great flavour.  The steak was cooked to my requested medium-rare, but unfortunately a bit lacking in the seasoning department.  The meat itself had no real flavour and relied heavily on the peppercorn sauce to spruce it up.  The sweet potato fries were absolutely divine, not too oily, and thin-cut just the way I like them.  I'd come here just to have these again.\n\nMy dining companion opted for the pasta special which was a Snow Crab Ravioli topped with grilled shrimp. The tomato sauce was very fresh.  I would've preferred if the ravioli were cooked just a tad more.  The crab was virtually absent or drowned out by the rich cheese filling as I couldn't discern any of the lumpy meat while eating this dish.\n\nTo finish off the evening we opted to share the Raspberry & Chocolate Tartufo ($7).  While it took awhile for the actual dessert to show up, it was well worth the wait.   The thin shell had a great texture to it - it reminded me of an Italian mochi with its slightly elastic exterior that was lightly dusted with cocoa powder.  The interior filling was dense and rich, with a raspberry centre.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThe staff at Pallucci make you feel like you're in nana's house.  They're warm, and serve you with a smile.  They were always around if you needed something, and quick to remove your plates when you've finished.  I must also thank Chef Siomra for bringing us 2 separate plates of salad even though we were sharing.\n\nThe food here doesn't leave you feeling heavy, and is very fresh.  With that said, the food could benefit from a bit of flavour development.", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg"}

A girl thinks my picture is kinda cute. I write reviews that demonstrate I passed high school English. She writes/compliments me... I'm cocky/funny. I offer to explore downtown with her. She turns me down. I try the next girl. Same result. But the intent is always there. After this review, I doubt I'll have to worry about succeeding with any woman who ever reads this review ever again. \n\nSo check it out. I'm a male slut. If I meet you in person and I lay my lines on you and smile in this certain way that I've discovered makes women look away and blush, you'll definitely give me your number and probably go home with me within one more encounter. That's my M.O. It works. If it ain't broke... \n\nI'm not altogether proud of the man I've become but I'm not going to stop either. From what I've gathered from movies and television, my life is fairly wonderful. Unless me writing about it causes some cosmic/karmic shift and I get disfigured in a car accident tomorrow and lose my mojo, I have several strong years of carousing left in me.  \n\nOk, all that said, I've been reading on Yelp about all the \"cougars\" who frequent this lovely establishment. I define a \"cougar\" not by age, but as a woman who knows what she wants (me). So my buddy, who's also a man about town and similarly successful in this field, and I decide that this is our new watering hole. We've been there twice in the last two weeks. Guess how many woman we've taken home or who have taken us to their homes in the last two weeks? Four. Guess how many we've given The Business to... The same four. Guess what our batting average is... .1000\n\nUsually, I need to take a woman out one more time before The Business is exchanged. Sometimes more if she's particularly prudish. Barcelona is where The Business is the understood currency. I like The Business. So if you're reading this and you think I'm scum, I used to be you. I've \"evolved.\" If you're reading this and you're a woman who knows what she wants, shoot me a message. And if you're reading this you think I'm lying because you didn't get laid last time you went there, I am willing to show you how. But you'd never take my advice because you don't believe me or think you'll succeed next time on your own or think I'm an ass for writing this and you don't want to meet me on principle.

Young things with massive...melons of flesh, meat-head men trying to look cool, 50+ women trying to outdo the young things, and 50+ men ogling everyone creepily.\n\nThe singers on stage were quite cheesy.  Great choice in music, but I'd much rather listen to the DJ version than a upscale karaoke.  No dude, you're NOT bringing sexy back with those aviator shades and check shirt.  And whoa...the female singer...honey, you need someone else to do your extentions.\n\nWierd mix of dress code:  from prom date to stained t-shirts.  Ugh.\n\n$9 for a pack of cigs (I don't smoke, but I heard) and you can order a drink in the bathroom.  Wha?  So you can drink and pee all night long and never have to leave the room?\n\nFunny, funny place.  I'd probably go again mainly for the abundance of people watching.  This place doesn't get more than three mainly for the cheese factor and the prices.  At least sugar daddies abound at this place.", "type": "review", "useful": 2, "user_id": "Q9NlyapDA97_NA0qaq8w0A"}

One downer is that I had to keep asking for a water refill, instead of them automatically checking in on us.\n\nAlso had the sugarcane drink but it tasted bland, like it was poured out of a can or a gallon, not at all fresh.  \n\nRecently, I was disappointed to find out this restaurant received a D from the county's health service, big turn off for any future return.  We hadn't planned on it anyway because the bill was too high for 2 entrees, one extra side of bread and a drink.", "type": "review", "useful": 2, "user_id": "4W-ZU-E82HWWUNNk9tfN6g"}

The paneer was just not right, too much tomato sauce and store bought paneer doesn't amount to great tasting butter paneer.  The chicken dishes were average to below average.

They have excellent tasting food, great ambience (because they actually employed an interior designer to do up their restaurant) and great prices.

Even their receipts have Chinese printings. That should raise some flags in your mind about how authentic this place is. But being the only choice for Thai food in the area, you don't really have a choice. After my first visit, I don't think this place is all bad. Some dishes were a hit and some were a miss.\n\nWe ordered a Thai combo for 4 for take out. They said the food will be ready in 10 minutes and they weren't kidding. I arrived about 10 minutes after I placed the call and the food was ready and packaged and sitting on the counter. We took the food home to eat and it pretty much confirmed my suspicions on authenticity. I'll comment on each item.\n\nRed Curry: Best dish of the night and tastes authentic. The dish is loaded with flavor and chicken pieces.\n\nPhad thai chicken: I've had phad thai at many places and there seems to be a wide range of difference. PP's phad thai feels like Chinese stir-fry to me. It seems to be missing some key Thai ingredients. Too light on the fish sauce, not enough eggs, and I think they used onions instead of shallots. \n\nBasil Beef: I don't feel the basil. It kind of tastes like regular Chinese stir-fry beef with veggies with an added spiciness. Compared with the red curry, the there's a lot less meat in this dish. Not bad, but doesn't feel Thai enough.\n\nTamarind Shrimp: I never want to eat this dish again. This is not tamarind. This tastes like Chinese sweet and sour sauce, and not a very well made one.\n\nTheir prices aren't cheap, but not outrageously expensive either. The portion size is generous. I would come again, but I'm definitely going to stick with the curries. I suspect this place uses powders for some dishes. I don't see how they could have prepped my meal so quickly otherwise. I'm most disappointed by the Phad Thai and the Tamarind shrimp. But I wouldn't mind ordering a curry again.", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "xVV86BToDOQGxE1gt9MMvg"}

Die guten Bewertungen im Internet, welche das Restaurant als bestes in Sindelfingen darstellen, sind teilweise Gefälligkeitsbewertungen, wie sich schon am Schreibstil leicht feststellen läßt. Zudem sind 25 Bewertungen von Personen, welche nur eine einzige Bewertung veröffentlich haben.\nDoch der Reihe nach:\n1. Besuch- Weihnachtsfeier unserer Firma- (ca. 25 Personen). Personal und Küche total überfordert. Getränke liefern funktionierte sehr schleppend und bis das letzte Essen kam, waren über 3 Stunden vergangen. Während sich ein Teil der Kollegen unten auf der Kegelbahn vergnügte, saßen andere da und warteten und warteten und warteten. Dabei war angekündigt, daß wir nach dem Essen gemeinsam die Kegelbahn nutzen wollen.\n2.Besuch- abends mit 3 Personen- Gaststätte relativ leer, dadurch Bedienung in akzeptabler Zeit, allerdings das Essen nicht übermäßig üppig. Da ich meine Frau und einen Bekannten eingeladen hatte, empfahl ich eben noch einen Nachtisch zu nehmen. Jetzt zeigte sich etwas, was in anderen Bewertungen im Internet schon sehr häufig beschrieben wurde, die familiäre Atmosphäre des Restaurants. Der Kellner setzte sich zu bekannten Gästen an den Tisch. Der Rest des Lokals wurde ab dem Zeitpunkt ignoriert, was sowohl Speisen, als auch Getränke betraf. Nach einer halben Stunde wurde es selbst dem Koch zuviel und er kam in die Gaststube, um den Kellner darauf hinzuweisen, daß seit 30 Minuten unser Tiramisu auf die Abholung wartet.\n3.Besuch -2 Paare- Im Sommer mal wieder ein Besuch. Restaurant relativ gut gefüllt und wir saßen auf der Terasse. Das man beim Bringen der Karte gleich die Getränkebestellung aufnehmen kann, war dem Kellner unbekannt, daher auch diesmal wieder lange Wartezeiten auf Essen und Getränke. Das Essen war nicht schlecht, aber so wenig, daß nicht einmal die beiden Frauem satt wurden. Unser Bekannter meinte dann auch zu seiner Angetrauten:\"Eigentlich hätte ich gern mal bei Dir gekostet, aber als ich die paar Stücken auf Deinem Teller gesehen habe, habe ich mich das nicht mehr getraut.\". Diesmal haben wir es dem Kellner auch mitgeteilt, daß niemand satt ist. Er empfahl uns noch Bruschetta oder Pizzataschen zu nehmen, was wir auch taten (natürlich auf Rechnung). Die anschließenden Ramazotti nach dem Essen waren natürlich brühwarm und der Getränkenachschub wie immer schleppend. Wir waren allerdings gut gelaunt und wollten uns dies auch nicht verderben lassen, so nutzen wir die Zeit um mal mit zu stoppen, wie lange die anderen Gäste so auf ihr Essen warten. Bei 2 jungen Burschen neben uns waren es anderthalb Stunden. Ein weiteres Paar fiel leider aus der Wertung, sie hatten zwar die Speisekarte erhalten, entschlossen sich aber nach ewiger Wartezeit auf die Bedienung zu gehen, daher mußten wir sie leider disqualifizieren. Irgendwann haben wir übrigens angefangen, unsere 8 leeren Gläser von Hefeweizen, Wein und Ramazotti am Tischrand in einer Reihe aufzustellen. Der Kellner verstand diesen \"dezenten\" Hinweis nicht. Das beim Kassieren das Weizenbier teurer war als ausgepreist, passte ins Bild.\n4. Besuch-4 Kumpels- Ich wollte mit 3 Freunden und dem Zug in den Schwarzwald, also entschieden wir uns vor den 4 Stunden Zugfahrt noch eine Pizza zu essen. Es war Freitagmittag und die Gaststätte mittelprächtig gefüllt. Nachdem die Bedienung wieder auf sich warten lies, ging ein Freund zur Theke, um nachzufragen, ob wir in einer Stunde und 15 Minuten 4 Pizza haben könnten. Dies war laut Kellner nicht möglich. PS. Im Eiscafe Firenze am \"Berliner Platz\", wo wir anschließend hingingen, war dies trotz mittlerweile kürzerer Zeit kein Problem. Fazit: Obwohl es nur 100 Meter zu fuß sind, nie wieder \"La romantica\"!!!!\"", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "JNueGUEcXPh4Ati1lAVLOA"}

Das Essen schmeckte allen 14 Gästen hervorragend (und das will was heißen, wenn man es allen 14 recht machen möchte)!!!\n \nEs gibt kaum ein Restaurant in der Nähe, wo Chef und Personal so auf die Wünsche seiner Gäste eingeht wie hier in Sindelfingen... Meine bzw. unsere Meinung bleibt bestehen - super Essen, super Ambiente, tolle Vorbereitung zu entsprechenden Anlässen, 100% Verlass auf die Organisation... DAUMEN HOCH... es war für alle ein gelungener 50. Geburtstag und wir kommen wieder und empfehlen dieses Restaurant von Herzen weiter...\n \nGanz liebe Grüße an das La Romantica Team - WEITER SO...\n \nMelanie Dicomy", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "BQ3FMt1iCWRqN7rah4JMUQ"}

Zwar ist das Ambieten etwas old fashioned, die Gäste scheinen z. T. Aus den umliegenden Hotels, z. t. Aber auch Stammgäste zu sein. Die Pizzen, die an den Nachbartischen serviert werden sind gigantisch, allein nicht zu schaffen. Ich habe mich heute eher der traditionellen ital. Küche verschrieben: Insalata Frutti Di Mare, interessant arrangiert mit viel Tintenfisch, Rukola und 2 gegrillten Garnelen, darauf Aceto Balsamicocreme : sehr lecker! Die Fritto Misto kamen dann leider Portionsweise, wobei ich das ganz witzig fand: zuerst frittierte Tintenfischringe, anschliessend Lachs und Garnelen. War wohl so nicht geplant, aber gut gekontert . Die Weissweinempfehlung ganz ausgezeichnet, ein Sartoni Marani aus Verona . Prima gekühlt, trocken zum Fisch und perfekt zum Menü ! Die Kellner dezent im Hontergrund und immer aufmerksam!

Bin zwar nicht so ein Salatfreund aber ich muss zugeben es war mal was anderes und ich werde es gerne wieder bestellen. Wie schon gesagt gab es als Hauptgericht ein Nudelgericht (frische Nudeln aus der hauseigenen Nudelproduktion) mit frischen Steinpilzen. Für mich gab es eine Dorade, es war außen kross gebraten und innen zart saftig, als Beilage gab es Bratkartoffeln in Weißweinsauce. Der Wein hat fantastisch zum Essen gepaßt, so konnten wir zur 2.

Ich nahm per eMail Kontakt mit dem Restaurant auf und bekam direkt Antwort vom Besitzer der gleichzeitig auch der Chefkoch ist. Mit ein paar kurzen Mails zwischen uns, klärten wir in etwa die Speisenfolge für unser Menü und letztlich versprach uns der Chef er würde uns mit einem köstlichen Fünf-Gänge-Menü überraschen. Auf diesen Deal liess ich mich ein und das war definitiv kein Fehler sondern eine gute und richtige Entscheidung.\nAls wir an dem Abend im Restaurant ankamen, wartete auf uns bereits ein liebevoll mit Rosenblättern, einem Rosenstrauß und einem silbernen Kandelaber mit aprikotfarbenen Kerzen dekorierter, edel mit Stofftischdecke und Stoffservietten eingedeckter Tisch.\nDer äußerst freundliche Kellner begrüßte uns und führte uns zu unsere mTisch. Unaufgefordert brachte er uns dann sogleich je ien Glas Prosecco als Aperitiv und zum Anstossen auf den Abend. In diesem Moment erschien auch der Chef selbst. Er kam aus der Küche, begrüßte uns ebenfalls sehr freudnlich und erläuterte uns mit welchen Genüssen er uns nun zu verwöhnen gedachte.\nDie Speisenfolge die er für uns ausgesucht hatte war folgende:\n1. Lachstranchen auf Weißbrot mit gedünsteten Gemüsestreifen 2. Vitello Tonnato mit selbstgebackenem Pizzaofenbrot3. Teigtaschen gefüllt mit Ricotta-Scampi-Lachs-Farce auf karamellisiertem Spinatbett4. Gegrillter Wolfsbarsch an würziger Orangensauce mit Pizzaofenbrot5. Panna Cotta auf Kramellspiegel\nDazu empfahl er uns als Getränk einen Weisswein, den wir allerdings nach kurzer Diskussion (da wir lieber Rotwein trinken) in einen 2003er Vino Nobile di Montepulciano umwandelten.\nDie Speisen die gereicht wurden, waren alle von erlesener Qualität und Frische. Jeder Gang - das war deutlich erkennbar - war vom Chef mit Kreativität und Hingabe zubereitet worden.\nDie Speisen waren auf Geschirr unterschiedlicher Form, sehr dekorativ und liebevoll angerichtet und waren köstlich im Geschmack. Die Mengen waren eher zu großzügig denn zu knapp bemessen und wir konnten meist die jeweilige Menge nicht vollständig verzehren.\nDas äußerst aufmerksame und dennoch sich dezent im Hintergrund  haltende Servicepersonal, sorgte dafür dass immer die Gläser mit Wein (der natürlich dekantiert worden war und in einem Dekanter gereicht wurde) und auch Wasser gefüllt waren, sowie wurde stets dezent nachgefragt, ob die Speisen und auch alles andere zu unserer Zufriednheit sei und ob ggf. etwas zusätzliches - wie z.B. ein Espresso zwischendurch - gereicht werden dürfe.\nDie absolute Krönung dieses ohnehin genial positiven gastronomischen Erlebnisses kam am Schluss, nach dem köstlichen Dessert, als der Chef aus der Küche sich - nach vorherigem Fragen selbstverständlich - mit zu uns an den Tisch sass, uns noch einen hervorragenden Grappa als Digestive und auf Kosten des Hauses anbot.\nVorher hatte er allerdings noch gefragt, ob er ein Foto von uns an diesem besondern Abend machen und uns noch ein Geschenk zum mitnehmen anbieten dürfe.\nKurz, das Foto diente dazu von ihm auf ein T-Shirt gedruckt zu werden, das er uns als Abschiedsgeschenk überreichte und dabei sehr ehrlcih sich dafür bedankte, dass wir seine Gäste waren und ihn und seine Speisen und sein Team gelobt haben.\nDer absolute Knaller kam nun aber ganz zum Schluss, als ich eher im Spass erwähnte, dass ich aufgrund des doch mehr als erwarteten Genusses von Prosecco, Wein und Grappa nun wohl doch ein Taxi rufen müsse und meinen Wagen dann eben am nächsten Morgen irgendwie abholen müsse. Da bot sich der Chef spontan an, natürlich nur wenn es uns recht wäre, uns mit unserem eigenen Wagen nach Hause zu fahren und sein Chefkellner mit seinem Wagen hinterher, so daß er wieder zurück kommen würde.\nWir haben das tatsächlich so gemacht und ich kann nur sagen, die Jungs und Mädels im La Romantica sowie das was sie bieten ist allererste Klasse und man wird so etwas und vor allem so eine Einstellung so leicht nirgendwo sonst finden!\nEines ist sicher, wann immer wir künftig in der Nähe sein werden, werden wir sicher dort wieder einkehren und ich bin fast sicher, vermutlich wie alte Freunde begrüßt und verwöhnt werden!\nFazit: Nicht nur empfehelnswert sondern ein absolutes Muss für jeden Gourmet und Freund italienischer Gastfreundlichkeit!\nÜbrigens, es soll nicht unerwähnt bleiben, dass der zu entrichtende Preis für diesen genialen Abend inkl. allen Getränken usw. mit rund 100€ auch wohl als mehr als preiswert zu bewerten ist.", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "lDbITzXjjkXYBXQ--RZwQQ"}

Fries that came with children's menu mac 'n cheese were overdone, too brown & crunchy. Mac 'n cheese was too hot for the baby to eat at first, but he wolfed it down eventually. My scrambled eggs were overdone and lukewarm. This place does not know how to do scrambled eggs. Waitress asked if I wanted my bacon crispy and I said yes - it came out almost burnt and cold. The toast was so smeared with butter substitute that it was soggy and cold by the time I got to it. Husband's order was wrong - eggs over easy turned into scrambled eggs, and his eggs were overdone too. He enjoyed his sausage and pancakes though, and I thoroughly enjoyed my hashbrowns. They were delicious. Granddaughter liked her kids' menu French toast and ate most of it. My coffee was good, but I had to bring my own flavored creamer - all they have is plain cream and sugar.\n\nOur waitress asked when we first were seated if we'd been there before, and we said yes. She breezed by 15 minutes later and asked the same question again. We said yes again. She seemed very rushed, distracted, and not terribly friendly. The place was busy, so maybe she was overworked, but we ended up feeling rushed too. \n\nOur waitress brought two loyalty cards with our bill, both with one stamp on them - she didn't ask if we already had a loyalty  card. Did she miss the part where we said yes, we'd been there before? When I presented my loyalty card to her and asked her to put the two new stamps on my card, she said (with attitude), \"We don't combine cards!\" I had to explain that she didn't even ask if I had one, and that I simply wanted her to stamp my card instead of giving us two new ones. She gave me one stamp on top of a spot that was already stamped, and when I pointed it out, she just gave me a new card with one additional stamp. We never did get that second extra stamp, but by that time, we were done with her. We left a minimal tip.\n\nToday's experience is pretty typical in terms of food quality. We go only if we have coupons. Unless I have a really great deal, like a Groupon or a two-for-one, I'll never visit 5 and Diner again.

This particular Five and Diner is as good as it gets for a Five and diner!!! \n\nThe owner, Val, is wonderful. Boy, she works hard and cares about her customers and her staff. \n\nMuch of her staff has been at this location forever, and Val has owned this restaurant for 13 years. Sometimes she has an awesome magician there.. and I usually hate when those magicians come by our table when I'm trying to enjoy my dinner. \n\nSo.. I love the people who work there, and I love the fun, festive atmosphere most of the time (depending on my mood). I love the music - though sometimes it's too loud. Again, this is probably due to whether I'm tired or my daughter is bugging me too much or I happen to have a headache, etc. I'm sure Val would turn down the music if you asked her to do so. She REALLY aims to please. \n\nThe food - sometimes very good and sometimes ho-hum, depending on what you order. It's what I would expect for a Five and Diner, which is why I give it four-star rating over all. What can I say?  I'm very picky about my food and my staff and my atmosphere. \n\nThe fries are great when you order them extra-crispy (which is how I always order my fries if I happen to get them). The club sandwich is great and HUGE - an excellent value. My husband ALWAYS orders the club sandwich, which he loves.  \n\nI order a variety of items whenever we go there, and I've found the breakfast items for dinner usually suit me the best. Tip: get the biscuits and skip the toast or tortilla, or hash browns, etc.. My daughter loves their macaroni and cheese and all their other kid items. I believe kid menu items are 99 cents when an adult purchases an entree on M-F. If not M-F, I know for sure kids are 99 cents on Fridays.", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "wN7jGqK_ZpB9KoYSAUyr0g"}

Normal question when ordering breakfast right? Well, when the bill came, little did we know that the pancake sandwich didn't actually come with bacon and the server put a dollar charge on the tab for adding bacon. When I confronted her about the dollar charge she said \"the pancake sandwich doesn't come with bacon, that's extra\". Well, we weren't informed that answering a question as to preference would result in an extra charge. We weren't informed that she was in fact adding things to our tab to inflate the price without telling us. I put up enough of a fuss that she removed the charge, and  I could tell that she knew she had added the charge in a duplicitous manner and she was just hoping we wouldn't catch on.

On this last visit, we ordered dinner.  The pot pie was okay and included a big dinner salad for about $8.  Not bad.  \n\nI somehow ended up spending $40+ for two adults and two kids on my last visit, even though kids were supposed to be 99 cents with the purchase of each adult entree.  \n\nPart of the inflated check was that the aforementioned waitress upsold the dessert to us at $3.99 per slice of cake or pie.  Let me review that dessert now.\n\nCarrot cake?  Nearly inedible.  With two people splitting a piece, 1/3 of it got eaten.  It tasted like it had been in a freezer.  DH, who loves carrot cake and could eat a whole sheet by himself could barely swallow a bite.  The 9 year old girl who ordered it said... \"this does not even taste like carrots.\"  I thought it tasted like a dry spice cake that had been frozen for a few months and then defrosted on the counter overnight.  \n\nCherry pie?  YUCK.  I split a piece with DD on her insistence.  I ate two bites.  I have to admit I am no pie connoisseur, but this was NOT good.  It was too-sweet, canned cherries in a tasteless crust.  Every cherry pie I have had before has had tart cherries.  I don't know how they got these that sweet, but it was just disgusting.  If a 4 year old who is usually never allowed sweets cannot finish off dessert, there is a problem.\n\nStill, the atmosphere is cute.

Our server was super attentive and friendly, and even gave my boyfriend his last refill to go so we could take it on the road with us.  All in all, a very positive experience, especially considering this type of diner usually has mediocre food.  We'll definitely be returning soon.  As a side note, I had been here once before a long, long time ago, and had the patty melt and that was awesome as well.  \n\nAs a side side note, I don't know what the person who said the dining room smells like a bathroom is talking about.", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "vbe6VKvvOHn0BkqAhhmEmw"}

Decided to eat with friends after watching Harry Potter.  Cana Latin Kitchen bar dishes are served just like Firefly restaurant, in small servings so one dish will not fill you up. It's set that way so you can have the opportunity to taste other things on the menu without getting full.\n\nStepping inside, the atmosphere was dark and intimate, a good place to take out a date to talk and drink wine together. The LCD tv at the center of the bar kind of ruins that mood a bit though. Monday night football was on and no one was really paying attention to it because everyone was involved in their own intimate private conversation and having one tv in this type of setup just doesn't blend in well.\n\nDespite having only one server that night, she was very attentive to everyone inside. I'll give the service a good review. I ordered the mixto ceviche (shrimp, scallop and calimari). The tortilla came separate with it which were served in potato chips size pieces.  Taste was ok but thats because I prefer my ceviche with a heavy lime taste.  I also ordered the fish taco which came in 3 small pieces.  I tasted my friends tuna ceviche too which I recommend to anyone that comes here. It was the best dish we had on our table.\n\nSo if you're ever around town square at night and on a movie date, stop by this place after. Great way to end a night if you don't feel like partying in the neighboring bars and just in a mood to have a quiet place to eat and have a conversation.", "type": "review", "useful": 4, "user_id": "6kvGowEk1AvUUwWHLkJyNg"}

Additionally, throw in the mojitos and tapas and we have the perfect summer spot. \nHowever, there are a couple things they need to work on.  The servers were amazing. The bartenders were a little slow and unresponsive but seeing the work it takes to make a mojito, I understand. \n\nWhat was strange was the managers that stood around and did nothing. No hi, no bye, nothing, just stood there taking up space. At first, I figured that maybe they were customers but later found out they were managers who just got in the way of the servers and the customers. It'd be better if they would of had personalities. Hopefully, that'll change as business increases.\n\nThe sangria was amazing ... and I don't even like sweet drinks. But the food was very subpar. It's nothing special and was very mediocre compared to a place like Firefly.

Everything else was ... eh and will not have me running back there to eat.

They market themselves as a ceviche place, and the ceviche is terrible. \n\nThis was my experience. I called in the afternoon to make a dinner reservation, and I was told I don't need one. Should've been a red flag. After much persistance, I convinced the host to just reserve me a table anyway. When I arrived, my party wasn't there yet, so I took my table because the bar was full. I wasn't offered a beverage for quite some time. \n\nWhen my friends arrived, they received warm water with no ice in a sticky glass. My sangria took a very long time to make. We ordered 3 dishes after waiting quite some time for our waitress. After about 20 minutes, the waitress told us that the chef had just informed her they were out of salmon... We were starving! Did she wait 20 minutes to put in the order? People around us were getting food. \n\nThe first dish to arrive was mini chorizo corn dogs. Flavor was terrible, no spice at all. The texture was even worse. Next we received the item that we substituted for the salmon, which was a crab ceviche. Completely over salted, and was more like tuna than crab. \n\nFinally our 3rd dish arrived, the hirame ceviche. When the waitress described it to us, she mentioned it was the special of the night which came with a salad. There was no salad. No greens. Nothing. This one was at least slightly tasty compared to the others, but it wasn't amazing. I contemplated dessert, but couldn't justify giving this establishment another cent. \n\nI was very glad that some of the people I was planning to dine with couldn't make it. I would hate for them to suffer through this meal. It was awful. Service - poor, food - poor, drinks - poor. \n\nI will say, however, that the place is decorated nicely. Wouldn't be bad to stop in for a beer before or after a movie. I just wouldn't eat.

But if you do not love this place you are missing a key part of your \"foodie\" DNA. This restaurant is the answer to every time you've said \"I wish I could try 5 plates\".  Tapas is small plates of each. Needless to say, when I got back to NY, I looked up a ceviche place within 24 hours.\n\nIf you are going once I'd recommend trying the ceviche, piggy back dates in goat cheese mouse, shrimp in chicharran sauce, short ribs and save room for homemade churros or that chocolate kiss with sea salt and chipotle sauce (?!?!?) \n\n- Hamachi ceviche - for those rookies like me....this is like sashimi/fish \"cooked\" in citrus by the acid. I've never had pickled hot peppers but its like sweet hot tangy awesomeness. (is it obvious I'm not a professional reviewer?) \n\nShrimp in chicharran sauce - crispy shrimp (they use 3 flours) with a little bit of pop. \n\nShort ribs -- one large short rib in guava glaze. Its probably the best bbq sauce with rich, slightly tangy, but smooth flavor. The meat was fall off the bone tender. \n\nPiggy back dates -- a must have. dates wrapped in bacon with an almond inside for some pop and then in a bed of white mousse. Come on!  I could eat these on the coach all day.  Best dish. A must have. \n\n- Mojitos - I have to admit I didn't have but was with 10 people and the mixed drinks and variations on the mojito shocked people. \"Not as sweet\" as most. \n\nLastly, service was perfect as you'd expect the timing for each dish to be difficult. \n\nI want to sit outside next time but it was packed so that wasn't possible but they seem to have the best view in town square. \n\nGun to my head I'd say I didn't like the chicken skewers but it turned out they were missing the rum glaze so that was the reason. \n\nI think what I loved most was just the variations on every dish. Yes they have corn dogs but they have chorizo. Yes the have mac and cheese but its has habanero in it. Piggy back dates with almonds and white mousse? Can you picture what that taste like? There's something for everyone here. Ceviche, mac and cheese, shrimp, pickled jalapenos, bread pudding. Not joking this place reminded me of dishes at Nobu and as I said to a friend, \"I'm not just saying this, but this might be the best meal I ever had\" I felt like I was trying to find something I didn't find mindblowing to seem credible when I told friends about it.

I know everyone on Yelp is obsessed with Firefly, but I can now confidently say I much prefer Cana! Before I get onto the main review, a few reasons why this place kicks Firefly's butt:\n\n*Well crafted, DELICIOUS drinks. I know we all love those sugary mojitos at Firefly, but the flavorings are all just powders and artificial. The fruit mojitos here are muddled with real fresh fruit - they used a half pint of blueberries on one freaking mojito that I watched them make! I much prefer real fruit to powdered mixes, but to each his own.\n\n*Service is exponentially better. The bartenders will actually take the time to get to know you and make sure you love your drink. My mojito gets thrown at me with no hello at FireFly\n\n*Atmosphere. I love the sexy lounge/patio they have going! Happy hour is till 7, instead of ending at 6 PM like it does on FF on Paradise. \n\n--------------------------\n\nI've said it once and I'll say it again - the drinks are awesome and they are why I come here. The mojitos are muddled with fresh fruit, and they have some awesome martinis. I do have to give the edge to Firefly on the sangria, however. They only have one kind at Cana and it's just oK.\n\nWe've tried half the menu and love nearly everything we've tried. I think the low point is sadly  the ceviche. We tried their best selling yellowtail ceviche and while it was fresh, I don't like their funky new style. If I want ceviche I want small pieces of fish, not 4 huge ugly slabs. It was sloppy and uninspired imo.\n\nOn the flip side, we really loved the beef empanadas. They aren't traditional, but wow the puff pastry dough is good. The mac and cheese is great as are the sliders. The flat breads and shrimp are both great and hearty portions to boot. I think our favorite was the short rib. A pretty damn big slab for $12 and covered in the most delicious sauce. \n\nIf you're a Firefly regular - give it a try. It's more sophisticated and the drinks are way better!

Was light and fluffy with ground beef and other spices in the middle...yum\n\n-Chicken empanada-not as good as the beef empanadas, but is aight.\n\n-Spicy tuna ceviche-one of us doesn't eat sushi/sashimi, but she thought this was delicious.  I honestly thought it was a bit too fishy while everyone else liked it.\n\n-Hamachi tiradito-the citrus brought out the flavor of this fish.  Was light and refreshing.  Was one of everyone's favorite.\n\n-Cuban Sliders-ham on top of pork, was kinda boring to me.  I like cuban sandwiches when there is a dipping sauce.  This one doesn't come with a dipping sauce.\n\n-Crispy Shrimp-one said that this reminds her of honey walnut shrimp, I didn't care too much for it.

The portion seem to be tiny for the amount of pickled cabbage given.\n\n-Chicken taco-Taste the best out of the three kinds of taco.  The pickled purple cabbage and a slice of jalapeno tasted very good with this chicken taco.\n\n-Fish taco-least favorite...the fish was BORING.  Didn't taste like much.\n\n-Churros-Everyone loved this desert.  It was so soft and fluffy, with a nice vanilla sauce (I think) drizzled on top of it.  Not a typical churro that one would get at El Pollo Loco, which I like too btw.\n\nSopapillas-Eh.  Whatevers.

Most dishes hover right above $10, and the portions certainly do not match what you're paying for.  Last night was my third visit here, and each time I've been sure to stop by during happy hour.  Happy hour is from 5pm-7pm daily and gets you the following items at discount price (discount prices are listed below, and are approx. ~50% off full price, plus or minus $1):\n\nBeef Empanadas, $6.00 - It's alright.  Ground beef with some veggies inside pastry bread.  I'll eat it but it's not my first choice.  Comes with two empanadas, each cut in half.\nMac & Cheese, $4.00 - This is some tasty mac & cheese, using white cheese, cheddar cheese and some habanero.  The kick from the habanero makes this something that I would order every visit.  Portion is good for two, maybe three less-hungry people.\nCuban Sliders, $6.00 - These are delicious little burgers!  Made with ground pork, with a little ham thrown on top just because.  They've been juicy and full of flavor every time I've ordered these (which happens to be every time I've been here).  Order comes with three sliders, which are small to begin with.  Not worth full price.\nCrispy Shrimp, $6.00 - Yes, it is pieces of shrimp.  Yes, it was probably crunchy at some time with some sort of breading.  But no, it is not crispy when it arrives.  Last night was the first time I ordered it, and the sauce it comes with (panko?) made the shrimp soggy.  It had a citrus flavor and wasn't bad, but I can't see myself ordering it again.  Portion was decent enough for two to share.\nChicken Skewers, $? - The fifth and final food item on the happy hour menu.  The menu is small to begin with, and only five items are offered with happy hour pricing!  I *think* I had this during a previous visit but I'm not sure.  I didn't order it last night.\nSangria, $5.00 - I think there were a couple varieties offered during happy hour, each being $5.00.  It's not my favorite drink so I didn't order.\n\nDuring my visits it seems that on average people are paying roughly $15-$20 per person depending on who gets drinks.  When I go to Firefly with a group it's usually about $20 per person and the food is tastier, with more generous portions.

So, when I saw this place in Town Square I had to check it out.\n\nFirst of all, there are 2 entries for Caña on yelp. Both refer to the same place but one has the address wrong. The correct address is 6599 Las Vegas Blvd. I'm posting my review under both.\n\nNow for the review... Caña is located in the spot vacated by Louis's Fish Camp and they did a great job of remodeling the space. Louis's had a small bar and the entry way was a little odd -- kinda felt like you were walking in through the back door to get into the restaurant because of the small door, walking by the bathrooms and getting a glimpse of the \"behind the bar\" area before getting to the dining area. With Caña, the doorway is larger and more inviting and the bar is pushed back, adjoining the patio areas. The interior of the place is much darker and intimate as well. The bathrooms are in the same location but are not as pronounced.\n\nAs for the food... ehh... it was ok but not great.  Not even \"really good\" either.\n\n- Hamachi ceviche -- as other reviews have mentioned they are not traditional ceviches. They're more like sashimi slices laying on a streak of citrus sauce. Hardly enough citrus to 'cook' the hamachi. It didn't taste all that fresh and lacked flavor.\n\n- Short ribs -- one large short rib in a deep pool of guava glaze. The meat was very tender but didn't have much depth in flavor. A few more spices would have given it some kick and made this a great dish, but the meat all on its own was a little dull.\n\n- Piggy back dates -- It seems like every tapas/bocadillos place HAS to have bacon wrapped dates. I guess I should be glad that this place did, because it was the best dish of the night. Great textures (although the amount of goat cheese mousse was overkill) and great flavors.\n\n- Beef empanadas -- the outside of the empanadas was flaky and a little crispy. The inside could have used more beef. Almost every bite was pastry with a hint of beef. The beef tasted pretty good, I just wanted more of it.\n\n- Crispy shrimp -- decent flavor, not as crispy as I would have liked.\n\n- Sangria -- while it did taste good, it wasn't strong enough and was too sweet. It wasn't what I was expecting.\n\nWe sat at the bar on a Saturday night and didn't have any trouble finding seats. The service was very good. Our bartender was on top of things and we didn't have to wait long for drinks or food even though he and the other bartenders were very busy (all those mojitos take a while to make). Our bill came out to about $88 including tip for two people... not bad. However, I doubt I'll be back for the food. Caña might be a cool/chill place for happy hour but there are better places around town for tapas. I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could, but 'm rounding up.", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w"}

The scallops were chewy and fishy and the ceviche's ingredients had a bad mixture of texture. The chicken flat bread was sparse. The salad was served the same way as coleslaw and bacon wrapped dates were greasy (goat cheese sauce tasted like sour cream). The meatballs dish was the only dish that we liked. I also ordered a glass of wine and it looked like it was two ounces. Our meal ended up being $74 and we were beyond disappointed. Cana should change it's layout into a lounge instead of a restaurant because it's more about the ambiance and view. The service was excellent and we tipped her accordingly but we will never go back.", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "ScVSkCSQLk0qipN4NT88pg"}

And we thusly found out there was no comparison. Cana's offerings were ok, but nothing outstanding. The food really felt like someone was reading receipts out of a cookbook and attempting to add their own \"flair\". And along with the mediocre food was the mediocre bartender, he literally left us with empty glasses for 10mins until we could get ahold of his bar back and had him actually make us drinks. \nFirefly is still the king of Tapas Eateries in Las Vegas for me, Cana's was a disappointment.", "type": "review", "useful": 3, "user_id": "QIrJKF0cJ04Vasv-rxOQ3Q"}

The drinks are consistent, the food is so fresh and flavorful..each and every time!  The weather is warming up so we are definitely looking forward to some warm nights on the patio.  They have a little lounge patio area with a few cushy seats that almost seems like my own private little living room.  Perfect!\n\nThis visit Cory (owner) stopped by the table and he gave us some previews of drinks he is creating for the summer menu. (Which by the way is a selling point to this ADHD foodie...new stuff on the menu is a big plus)  I can't talk too much about the spicy, savory, tasty drinks we tried but let's just say one of them bit me!  There is also a new Sangria on the menu which is so refreshing and not too sweet.  Made with a Malbec and citrus juices (and Bacardi O) it is going to be the perfect complement to a warm Vegas breeze, swaying palm trees and ceviche.  \n\nSpeaking of ceviche we tried the Mushroom Ceviche.  I think it was made with Beech Mushrooms.  Those were new for me.  They were soaking in a citrus marinade that made raw mushrooms absolutely tasty.  We also had the Spicy Tuna Ceviche and the Mixto made with shrimp, scallops, and calamari (they have an 'choose 3' offer that we couldn't resist).  The 3 of those along with the Hamachi was almost enough for us.  \n\nBut even before the ceviches were ordered I could smell the aroma of truffle coming from the table next to us (and NO I am not sick of truffles yet)...so what did we have to try? The new Truffle Chips.  Um, HELLO, I need a whole bag of those right now!  Thin crispy waffle cut potato chips with grated parmesan and truffle oil.  You know how some of us like the really brown potato chips and pick them out of the bags? Well, these chips were like those on steroids.  I think I ate them all, but sorry, my eyes were closed and I was in Heaven so I don't really remember.\n\nThings to try: the Watermelon Ginger Margharita, the new Sangria, and the freakin' awesome Truffle Chips!\n\nAnd thanks Cory and GM (Ben I think?) for making our visit so entertaining, educational and above all...FUN!", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "0kLYM03OtK-qeVNrk3sUbQ"}

The Diablo Dulce was exactly that, spicy and sweet- and utterly satisfying. The Sugarcane sangria was really good, and really sweet; I asked our waitress and from her description of its ingredients, -maybe it should be called High Fructose Corn Syrup Sangria.

I didn't have any sugar cane drinks. I had a glass of wine and some food.\n\nThe atmosphere is dark and sexy and suave, and I do love a good atmosphere, but at Cana you pay for the atmosphere. The food was expensive for tapas. We had a ceviche, which was decent. I had no real complaints there, but some of my friends did not think it was the freshest. Then we had an $11 chicken flatbread. For $11, I expected some mega-chicken and assorted toppings, but there were maybe 9 little cubes of chicken and close to no mango that was promised on the menu. Not cool. The yucca frites were not too special, and the \"crispy\" $12 shrimp were not crispy at all. They were a bit soggy. Plus, most everything came to the table not hot. I hate not hot tapas.  \n\nI am willing to grant that perhaps I came on an off night. There was a manager type who appeared to be running dishes, when generally that is a task reserved for the waitstaff.

They need some sort of sign of life out front. We went here on a week night thinking it was Happy Hour menu. There were 3 of us. We ordered a ton of food wanting to try it all. And thinking Happy hour pricing. The server was training someone. You could tell they had both been drinking already. There were 3 tables in the restaurant and it was freezing in there. I wore my winter coat through the whole meal and still my teeth were chattering. The dynamic duo weren't sure if the the Beef Tenderloin Tiradito was available. We ordered Ceviche, tuna, dates, sliders, and short ribs, plus the beef tenderloin which we did not know if it was coming or not until it arrived. Usually tapas comes a few things at a time. Here it took forever and then BAM, it was all on the table. I have to say everything was delicious. I refused to share the beef tenderloin. The Sangria was very good too. After we ate we couldn't take anything as it doesn't travel well. So, don't overorder. The check came and we were surprised at the amount. My daughter had just been there the week before and they had Happy hour pricing at the time we were there. We asked the waitress what was going on with the check. She gave a long winded story about new specials and hours for Christmas shoppers. And went on forever, about lunch specials. Finally, we think she said they had changed the Happy Hours and we had missed it by 5 minutes. I know, we should have asked. But it is also good customer service to say \"sorry you just missed Happy Hour\". Especially since it changed from the previous week. We would have ordered the same anyway. It's the point that of all the 1000's of places in Vegas, we went there for food and Happy Hour. I am undecided if I will return. The service is the lowest. But the food is really good.

Obviously they did nothing to improve my on my previous review.  The owners of this place own several places in town, some great and some ok, so they obviously could care less what I had to say.  It is about the food!  If you make great food then people will come.\n\nI am a sucker for trying every new place around, despite the countless bad reviews I read.  Cabo''s was the latest of the new places I've tried.  Was the food horrible?  No, the food was not horrible.  Was the restaurant dirty?  No, the restaurant was actually very clean and nicely decorated..  Was the service bad?  No, the service was ok.  \n\nIf nothing was horrible then why the two stars?  There are countless Mexican establishments in Champaign/Urbana and I've eaten at every one of them.  I would go eat at any of the good ones before going back here. The menu didn't contain 200 items like many of the other establishments, which I found kind of refreshing.  However, the prices were crazy high for Mexican food.  They charge $13.00 for a Fajita and $3.00 more if you want meat such as chicken or steak on it.  That is $16 for a Fajita that would be $9-$12 everywhere else.  \n\nThe food was not horrible, but it was bland.  The fajitas lacked flavor.  I had to salt and pepper it to make it taste like something.  When have you ever had to add salt and pepper to a Mexican dish after it has been served?  If the answer is more than zero then you've likely eaten at Cabo's or another bad Mexican restaurant. \n\nThe service consisted of countless college aged students of European decent.  I scanned the staff and didn't see one person that appeared to come from a Mexican background.   This is usually a worrisome sign for me at any ethnic restaurant, particularly at a Mexican restaurant.  This place could be Mexican-American owned and operated, but I doubt it.  The employees I encountered were pleasant, but the experience was nothing special.  Before you bash me as some white hating individual I must disclose that I'm white.  I also believe that my fellow fair skinned man can cook good ethnic food, but rarely is it ever as good as a person from that particular ethnic background (in this case Mexican). \n\nWith all the other Mexican establishments in town why would I eat here again?  I won't, I'll take my business and money elsewhere where I can get a better meal for less.  If you must try it then go ahead as it won't be a horrible experience, but don't say that you weren't warned.", "type": "review", "useful": 2, "user_id": "oJl-C8UECsibhHS2dB8yzQ"}

Earlier reviews state that the beans seem to come from a can...disagree. It's called substance. Overall, great experience and will definitely be trying again to confirm!", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "LNF5pDUmzTAeorTyuvzqRQ"}

It was great while it lasted.***\n\nWe stopped in for an early dinner. We left filled and satisfied.  The food was very good and we will definitely be back. We had cheese curds as an appetizer. They were tasty, but they are breaded and then deep fried and served with a sauce. The sauce was a wonderful tomato-jalapeno-fruit sauce (can't fully identify the fruit), and it may have some roasted red pepper.  Truly good sauce.  The curds themselves were unexceptional. Too much breading, but that seems common in this part of the country.  (We prefer curds warm and \"naked\" with a spice \"rub\" rather than a sauce. But I'm not complaining. They were good.)\n\nThe main courses likewise were really good. The pork tacos had ample seasoned pork, cilantro, onions, and (oddly) sour cream. But the mix of flavors was very good, and I added the green salsa (that came with the chips) to mine.  The squash tacos were a real surprise, especially at a restaurant like this. They were spicy and perfectly done. Both taco dishes came three to a plate on soft corn tortillas.  The crisp was billed as a Mexican pizza-- a flour tortilla filled with cheese and toppings. Not quite a tostada, so Mexican pizza is probably as good a description as any.  It was piled high and easily shared. And, most important, it was delicious.\n\nThe chips and salsa were good. The salsa, in fact, was very good. Especially the hot salsa. It was a tomatillo salsa but with lots of peppers but still not really hot.  The red salsa was billed as mild, and it was. None in our party found it exceptional.  The chips were warm and very salty. I couldn't tell for certain, but I don't believe they are made on the premises.  \n\nThe menu is relatively large and broad, ranging from tilapia to steak to tacos and burritos. And there are many choices in each category. Carnivores and vegetarians both will find things on the menu, though vegan vegetarians may not find much.  It isn't really Mexican; if you are looking for authentic Mexican you should go to Maize or El Charro. The food here is Mexican Inspired. I'm not knocking it. It is delicious. The steaks and seafood with Mexican spices were amazing, and they have a greater variety of tacos than do the more authentic places. The chefs may have worked in a steakhouse as they really know how to cook the steaks.  And the spices and sauces add to the flavors rather than smothering or overwhelming the meats or vegetables. \n\nThe place has one other feature that many of our Mexican style restaurants lack: a lovely decor. Although says Cantina and Grill on the sign, this is a sit-down restaurant if you want it to be.  On the side away from the bar it has normal tables, while the bar area has service at the bar and at those \"tall tables\" that require high chairs to sit at.  The decor is simple but very nice, the music was quite low and we could easily talk over it.  There are several TVs and I suspect it serves as a nice sports bar on game days.  \n\nThe wait staff was wonderful. They would explain any dish you might have questions about, and they make recommendations if you give them guidelines about what you are looking for in a meal.  Very professional and amazing given that they've only been open for a week.  \n\nParking is ample and we were seated immediately. The waitress took our drink order less than five minutes after we were seated, and the drinks arrived promptly, as did the chips and salsa, and both were refilled quickly and without our needing to ask.\n\nAll in all, I think this place is off to a great start in Champaign! I suspect it will become one of our regular stops.", "type": "review", "useful": 4, "user_id": "tQBrhzi7ixctWgthHHSHgQ"}

I cannot wait to come back here for dinner, this time with my husband. When I took my first bite of the pork taco, there were so many flavors bursting in my mouth! It was spicy and juicy! Pork was cooked so perfectly! My mouth was definitely in heaven. Next, I had the most amazing spinach salad. There was a mild curry flavor and the tangerines and onions made it so crisp and fresh! That has been the best salad I have ever had. But I have to say, that the winner of it all for me at least is the sauce that came with the cheese curds. I am calling it the \"Magic Sauce\". I hope the owners would start bottling that sauce and having it for sale. I would definitely stock my pantry up with it. \nWhat I liked most is the variety they had. I even had a fabulous burger that was mildly spiced and had a cumin type flavor to it. Unfortunately for me, it was lunch time and since I had to go back to work, I did not have a cocktail. Looking forward to going there again soon with my husband and getting some cocktails as well. I hope this place never goes out of business.

The tacos are described as spicy, and they were - way hot cayenne.  Service was OK, rushed, but everything got there.  The second trip was way better, service was friendly, and relaxed.  They were not as crowded.  We had burgers, and steak tacos.  I had the Black Jack burger with fried jalapeno, cheese, and two beef patties.

I went there for lunch with some co-workers.  The man who seated us seemed to be annoyed that we came in.  The bartender has to come wait on us because the rest of the staff just stood around talking.  Overall the service wasn't that great.  We were then brought two kinds of salsa that we were told were made \"in house so they are extra yummy.\"  The salsa had no flavor.  Was very unimpressed and disappointed.\n\nThey have no lunch menu.  Everything is one price/one size.  This was disappointing.\n\nI ordered the chicken burrito.  My co-worker had ordered the spicy pork burrito, and the third person decided not to eat because she was so put off by the who situation.\n\nThe burrito came out and looked good, but boy was I wrong.  They use black beans, which tasted like they were from a can and not washed off.  They tasted like they had been sitting in some sort of brine solution.  There was rice, which had no flavor either.  The rice they serve seemed a bit over cooked, had corn in it, and was very bland.  Basically they take a couple tortillas, spread some cheese on it, then rice, beans lettuce and the chicken.  They then \"grill\" it.  The lettuce was wilted and soggy.  Gross.  I cut the whole thing in half to eat the chicken.  It was the best part, but that's not saying much.  The chicken was salty...VERY SALTY.  I took the rest home thinking that I might be able to salvage it or give a bit to my dog, but it smelled so incredibly bad that I just threw the whole thing out at home.  Don't waste your time or money.\n\nI prefer to support locally owned business, especially restaurants since I worked in the industry for a long time, but this was just overall a very bad experience.", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "MTsuAZdma0LzPa4dB50RnA"}

You get your food in seconds, but it's pretty much just the same ingredients shuffled around in different combinations, and each component is not all that great. Not BAD, but not great. I think this is the first truly great place for Mexican I've eaten at in Champaign, which is why I'm throwing caution to the wind and actually giving it a full five stars.\n\nI just started going a few weeks ago, and I've been there three times since. I've always found the wait staff to be really pleasant. They do get pretty busy during dinner, but I've never had a terrible wait and usually get seated right away. It might help that I tend to eat dinner a little earlier, if possible.\n\nYou get chips and salsa, of course, to start at no charge. Their chips were fresh and light and warm. Nothing is a bad sign like bad tortilla chips at a Mexican restaurant. I have tried the guacamole and the queso. Of the two, I preferred the queso as an add-on dip for the Nachos. The guacamole was okay, but it could have used more lime, and I prefer my guac a bit chunkier.\n\nPossibly the best thing on their menu are their crisps, which are like little mini-pizzas on a tortilla-based \"crust.\" The crust of them is perfect. Delicate and flaky and crispy, which you'd hope based on the name. I've had bites of two different crisps-the pork and the red pepper varieties. I preferred the pork overall, but both were full of flavor. Their cheese and sauces seem of a very good quality and are very flavorful.\n\nI've also tried their pork tacos. The tortillas uses for their tacos (white corn, I believe) are great. Soft, with a little bit of texture and tooth to them. I did think their pork could used a tad more heat, but other than that they made a good lunch portion with the chips.\n\nDesert-wise, you must try their fried ice-cream! It's the best I've ever had. It seems like a hard thing to mess up too badly, but plenty of Mexican places that bother to offer it, do. It has a sweet, flaky crust and delicious chocolate drizzle. It might be nice if you got two coated, smaller scoops of ice cream instead of one larger one, just to balance out the crust and ice cream proportions a bit better. Still, it's delicious.\n\nAs far as drinks go, I have had two of their Margaritas. The first was a Blackberry and Basic concoction, and was my favorite of the two. I didn't get a ton of basil from it, but there was enough there to make it interesting. The other was a pineapple and coconut Margarita. This had a great taste, though I didn't get much coconut from it other than the toasted coconut on the rim of the glass. Neither skimped on the alcohol.", "type": "review", "useful": 3, "user_id": "gF37cxBOnIi3ZoC6FKmu-Q"}

I mean SALTY. Like hey, want some food as a side to your jug of morton's salt with that? Now, I am not one of those people on a low sodium diet, where you body goes into shock consuming salt. I consider myself having a pretty normal diet. The guacamole was salty. Black beans couldn't even taste beans because it was sooo salty. Rice was mushy and had no flavor at all. I tried my husband's chicken burrito, and it was salt with chicken essence. We wouldn't even bag it up for our dogs to eat. I had the cheese enchiladas. HORRIBLE. It was like a really bad quesadilla with some red sauce on it. No use of Mexican cheeses-- just really shitty kraft cheese that my knife wouldn't even cut through. \n\nService: Meh. Had to ask the bartenders for menus as no one was coming to our table. Server was new and didn't know the menu when we had a couple questions. When she saw that I only ate a bite of my food, she didn't ask if there was anything wrong or how she could fix it. Big no no. I was a server for 5 years and you just know when something isn't right with your customers. \n\nDrinks: Meh. I had the blackberry margarita, which tasted of only blackberry syrup. Needed to be cut with fresh lime juice. \n\nWe left with both of us wanting to throw up and head to the sauna to sweat out the salt. Seriously eating bad Chinese food and a bunch of sunflower seeds would still be less salt than this place. \n\nBasically if you like suburb quality Mexican food that uses frozen and not fresh ingredients come here.", "type": "review", "useful": 2, "user_id": "4bsc9m93QmN6bMocwaMS5w"}

He was in clear view and in the way of the service traffic. Nobody that worked there said a word to this oaf as he chowed down! We just looked at each other and laughed in disbelieve! Good thing we don't use ketchup on our eggs! The funniest thing was after we got our food the the tide of people that came in behind us must have overwhelmed them! The staff looked horrified like they didn't expect this much overflow on Mother's Day or capable of handling it! Only got one refill of coffee in this panicked frenzy of pisses off staff and patrons!

It had an odd taste.  It also appeared to be overcooked around the edges.  There was quite a 'crust' on it.  Overall, not appetizing at all.  The 'mashed' potatoes were quite lumpy.  I had to finish mashing them with the fork.  It appeared they had been mashed quickly, possibly just before they were served.  Again, lack of seasoning, particularly salt.  Not good at all.   I didn't finish either item.\n\nAnd when I tried to pay my check, there was no one at the register.  I probably stood there about 3 minutes before another customer got in line behind me.  She finally summoned a waiter and asked if we could pay our bills.  The response was, \"I don't know where she is.\"  He then disappeared for a moment and then returned and said \"She will be with you in a minute.\"   Not good customer service.\n\nThe whole meal was not very good.  While the price was reasonable, the food didn't live up to the hype that I received.  I don't think I would either recommend this place or go there again.

All it took was the words \"Churrasqueira\" on the sign to convince me to step inside and abandon my plans of going to the gym. I'd never heard of a Churrasqueira before, but it sounded kinda like \"Carniceria,\" which always means good food.\n\nI parked my bike in front of a be-toqued hobo and crossed the threshold. This place is the real deal. Boisterous olive skinned people (the Portugese?) conversed loudly with each other across piles of chicken and glasses of red wine. A baba-from-the-old-country-looking lady sat in a corner, monologuing to a group men standing around in jackets and scarves. Everyone seemed like they belonged here, like they either worked for the place or were related to someone who did. Some hilarious over-the-top foreign soap opera played in the corner, unwatched.\n\nAbout the time when I was starting to feel out of place, this sweet girl behind the counter grabbed my attention and set me at ease with a good old \"hi there, let me know if you have any questions!\" I ended up ordering the half chicken special, the words leaving my mouth slow and gummy due to the fact that my lips were still frozen. I'd hoped I made a good first impression, because this girl became my rock. Within two minutes of stepping into this place I felt like I had been dropped into another country and I was gonna need a friend.\n\nInitially, I had planned to grab the food and go, but the ambience was so pleasant that I decided to stay, even if that meant eating dinner in a restaurant by myself while being scrutinized by locals. I pulled out this new neuroscience book that I'd been hoping to read and got to work on it; waitress girl brought out some bread and butter. Ahhhh yeaa, I was gonna make of night of this.\n\nBefore I knew it, the chicken dinner arrived. The thing was huge, one of those classic big Italian dinner plates piled high with salad, spherical potatoes, chicken, and dipping sauce. It was truly the biggest pile of food I'd ever seen at a restaurant in Toronto.\n\nThe chicken was fantastic. Rubbed with salt and some interesting combination of spices. It was totally worth breaking this week-long vegetarian streak I'd been on. The potatos, too, were remarkable: salty, roasty, and inherently satisfying. However, the best part of the dish was the piri piri sauce. This stuff (which waitress girl later informed me was handmade made in house), had the perfect balance of heat, acidity, and flavor. It also had a fair bit of creaminess that really rounded out the flavor of the potatoes.\n\nAll too soon, the chicken was gone and I was stuffed. I felt truly good. Not even the thought of having to bike through the snow could put a damper on my chicken-fortified spirit. I'd had a good meal, made some progress on this book, and found a cool new place to eat where I felt welcome. I think the waitress even called me cute at the end there. Ahh yeaa.", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "javH5G2S3JihyfbBsfJQLg"}

The grouper was quite tasty, although we weren't sure that it was actually grouper.  The half chicken was probably the best dish of the night and came with a delightfully spicy dipping sauce.

Es liegt nur ca. 20 Gehminuten von S-Hoffeld entfernt. Das Gebäude gehört wohl irgendwie zum TSV Birkach der dort diverse Sport-stätten betreibt. Vermutlich war es mal die Vereinsgastätte. Überbleibsel finden sich in der teilweise übernommenen Inneneinrichtung wieder u.a. (hellbraune Holztische) \nEs gibt einen Tresen und ausreichende Sitzmöglichkeiten die den heutigen An-sprüchen angepasst wurden. Trotz allem blitzt das Sportlerheimambiente durch, dem sollte sich jeder Besucher bewusst sein. Zum Essen: Das Angebot (bis 1.4.10 nur Mo/Di/Do) versprach 200g frisches Filet-Steak mit Beilagensalat für 15 EUR pro Person ! Der (gemischte) Salat wurde vorab auf einem kleinen Teller mit Dressing serviert. \nEr überzeugte durch seine Frische, kein Billigkraut aus dem 10-Liter-Eimer, bis auf die Gurkenscheiben, die wohl schon länger aufgeschnitten rumlagen. Das Steak wurde kurz drauf aufgetischt. Garniert mit einem großen Salatblatt, ein kleines Stück Kräuterbutter und Danke der Küche eine Portion Kartoffelecken ;-) Das Steak war nicht ganz nach meinem Wunsch gebraten, was ich aber nicht reklamierte. Es war sehr schmackhaft, zart innen und aussen lecker kroß angebraten. Wirklich sehr gute Qualität. Fazit: Gutes Essen zu angemessenem Preis, sehr freundliche und nicht aufdringliche Bedienung.\nEin Besuch ist lohnenswert.

Also, I wouldn't look at the floor if I were you...\n\nThe reason John's gets 4 and not 3, is they have what I call a great 'diner waitress'. A great diner waitress is somebody who is very efficient, never misses anything, and always keeps your coffee hot. She calls you 'hun' or 'sweetie' but it somehow isn't patronizing like it is when other people say it. Don't know her name and she's very young but she is great and is always there. \n\nJohn's is a classic type place - looks rough on the outside, not too far behind on the inside, but will serve you up a good, hot meal quickly and cheaply.  Oh, yeah - CASH ONLY.", "type": "review", "useful": 5, "user_id": "Z0GBHiE7QpWlymLMnUP8SA"}

Too many restaurants slink around your ankles like beaten dogs, cravenly asking, \"Do you want anything, sir?  Please?  Yes, I can get it for you, restaurant-Gollum loves the master, we adoreses you...\"\n\nJohn's Diner will serve you, but on its own terms.  They treat you like people; they're happy to see you, but they've been around for fifty years and will be around for fifty more.  The waitresses tell you what's going on in the back, complain merrily about the job, bring your food to you, pat you on the shoulders.  They have that quiet pride that says, \"If you behave well, you're part of the family here.  If not, here's the door.\"  I didn't ask for anything special, but one suspects that if I asked them for, say, a pomegranate-infused soda, they'd look at me sternly and go, \"Now, what did you want THAT for?\"\n\nAs such, it's supremely pleasant atmosphere.  This is a classic DINER diner, a long narrow train tube with a row of stools for the quick eaters and beat-up booths in the back, where the scents waft out of the kitchen behind the counter.  \n\nThe food?  Well, as Gini notes, they put the greasy in greasy spoon, but that's actually part of the charm; they don't care about eating healthy, they want you to eat hearty.  They have all the greatest diner hits, from eggs and bacon to open-faced turkey sandwich, and the food is not exceptional but it is home-made and fills you up quite nicely on a low budget.\n\nWould I recommend this to my snooty foodie friends?

There were items hand-written into the menu, the elderly waitress made a comment that the \"chef\" was new, and the register was brand new to the waitress as well. \n\nSo, anyhow, the story:\nTwo adults and one child (age of 5). Empty diner except one elderly gentleman who showed up while we were there. The establishment was dirty....don't care. I actually expected it and may have been disappointed had it not been. The waitress needs to retire. She seemed to be struggling stringing sentences together a little. Still, not a big deal. \n\nLet's order!\n\nSo the child of our bunch ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, the adults meals were roast beef and mashed potatoes and gravy as well as swedish meatballs over noodles. \n\nEach meal came with the soup of the day (a creamy spinach soup with whatever those noodles are in wedding soup). I ordered the chili on top of that just to have a taste. The chili was GROSS! Not like a gross like this is too sweet, or too salty, or just not a good recipe....it was GROSS in a way that can only be described as it seemed as though it was so old and re-used or SOMETHING that it developed a taste of nothing with the consistency of cream of wheat. \n\nThe soup of the day came out.....again.....GROSS!!!! Gross for the same reasons except this also had the added pleasure of tasting like they \"of the dayified\" the soup pot by adding a block of salt. VERY gross. I eat EVERYTHING no matter what. I dd NOT eat this.\n\nSpaghetti comes out. Giant portion for a kid but one can't complain about that. Sad-looking but no bog whoop. She enjoyed it.....she's 5. \n\nThe roast beef and mashed potatoes come out. Immediately I see those scooped, starchy, obviously flake potatoes.....no big whoop. Not my cup of tea but they can;t be that bad. The roast beef, however, looked (and I tasted it) and tasted HORRIBLE! It had a gray tinge to it, had the appearance of a texture closer to pencil shavings (only larger) and there was literally zero moisture left in it at all. Gross but let's press on.\n\nWhile that was going on, I heard the waitress speak to the \"chef\" and explained that the Swedish Meatballs over noodles uses egg noodles and not spaghetti noodles and moreover (she didn't use that word I assure you) the \"sauce\" is a brown gravy and not marinara sauce. There was some kind of muttering of acknowledgement and the waitress let me know that there was a problem and that my meal would be out shortly. \n\nThe \"chef\" tried to give me the exact same thing the child across from me had and call it \"Swedish Meatballs Over Noodles\"!!!! Wrap your brain around that! So, after a brief lapse, the plate comes out....unbeknownst to me half my plate had spilled onto the counter during transport and the waitress had used a couple spools to get it back onto my plate before giving it to me. MMMMMMMMM!!!!! Then I look down. It's the same meatballs sitting across from me, the same spaghetti noodles (not egg noodles) sitting across from me with the same brown gravy sitting across from me.....ok, I'm not a debutante...I'll tough it out. \n\nI sliced into the first meatball. I took a bite. It was nearly frozen in the center had a salty briny taste from the gravy that also seemed spoiled. It was gross. The very first time in my years I just pushed a plate away and refused to eat it. \n\nThe waitress came over shortly after and asked how everything was. I let her know that I will kindly pay for these meals but would not feed these things to a stray dog. I let her know this was the first time I ever said this dining out. \n\nShe asked if she could take something off the check? First off, the right thing to do is to just apologize and comp the meal....I wasn't about to debate what should be taken off, get into a mathematics quiz with someone who seems confused that she is even working at a restaurant (again, no offense but she just needs to stop). \nSo we all got up and walked toward the register. This is how we found out that the register is new......\nSo I was charged a little over 20 bucks. I handed the waitress 2-20s and asked if I could just have a 10 back. This was a problem. She could figure out how to open the drawer or use it in any way. She talked to it in disdain and was even starting to have that same kind of demeanor Kathy Bates had in Misery. Losing it to say the least. I felt bad at first but then she started to smack the register each time a button press was unsuccessful....kinda in a way when you first find out your girl is a little bit kinky but you aren't quite sure what that means.", "type": "review", "useful": 2, "user_id": "-HLE-x7Lpkfprd6er-JFGg"}

It was oversalted (and I LOVE salt!), overcooked, and a lot of good ideas just missed the mark.

Pull it now!\" \n\nJust as the dude is about to pull my patty off the grill, the other guy says, \"It's a spicy,\" so the first guy puts my surely overcooked patty back on the grill and covers it with grilled onions to warm up the onions.

I knew this was happening and I said nothing because I assumed people who are paid to cook burgers everyday know more than I and because I didn't want to be one of those people. This is what happens when you restrain yourself because you don't want to be one of those people. You end up with a dangerously  blackened (seriously dangerous, read the studies about blackened grill meats)  burger and a little of your soul dying as a good burger goes up in flames (literally!). I would have brought it back, but I was in a big rush and I didn't have time to watch them ruin another patty. \n\nThe Big Smoke head office people need to get on this situation and do some remedial training for this crew. This is unacceptable. You can't serve people blackened, dried out patties. It doesn't taste pleasant and it's not safe to eat.", "type": "review", "useful": 2, "user_id": "leJEG7VNrgaU1Ck0zAO-DQ"}

With a communal indifference to the dinner option after our blunder, we agreed. The warning sign should have been how empty the restaurant was with a single patron sitting at the back of the restaurant working vigilantly on her computer and nursing a beer.  The lone waitress didn't greet us, didn't nod an acknowledgment and didn't seem to give a rat's that we were there. Despite this, after deciding on a table, we sat ourselves down and patiently waited for the lone ranger to wander over. 10 minutes later, she strolled over and handed us three menus with a half assed greeting. \n\nNow, it's a no brainer: you come to a chicken wing place, you get something chicken related. However, I'm weird about touching my food and without fail, will always vote for the boneless option. So, you can imagine the gut sinking feeling when the waitress reappeared 15 minutes later and she advised they were out of the boneless option. \n(Why it would take 15 minutes to flip through the three page menu, [one of which consists of wing flavours to decide] in order for you to draw the conclusion that A: You want chicken. B: You want it in some variety, or C: You like to play on the wild side (see what I did there?) and stray away from the traditional by getting a burger.) (You daredevil, you.)  \n\nFine: I will meet your lack of boneless option and go with the chicken fingers. \n\nI should have taken the no boneless option as my third warning to run while I still I had a chance. \n\nUpon the waitresses arrival, we were greeted by plastic plates (why on earth any establishment would be serving their meals on plastic plates purchased at their local Dollarama is absolutely BEYOND ME) and quite possibly the soggiest, stalest tasting nachos. The salsa tasted rancid, and the lettuce was wilted. Upon the arrival of my entree I encountered what appeared to look like it had come straight out of a Hungry Man frozen dinner... the chicken fingers smelled off... like they'd been sitting in the back of the fridge. I was feeling ballsy, so I took a bite... I wasn't convinced. My boyfriend's GarPar chicken wings followed suit, and they were bland tasting.\n\n20 minutes later when our waitress arrived to do a very delayed quality control check, she asked how everything was tasting. I explained to her the lack lustre experience I was having with my meal, she stared at me blankly as she asked me several times to describe how they tasted...they tasted freezer burned...they tasted off...how many other ways did I need to find in order to describe this? \"Do you want another meal made?\" No, I want to get out of here as quickly as possible...instead I asked for some more sour cream...I should have anticipated that upon her return, the sour cream would be extremely watery and very off in texture. An elderly couple helplessly attempted to flag down our waitress whom she ignored several times before the poor woman with an evident bad hip hobbled over to her requesting her attention. Given the destitute of people within the restaurant, it was easy enough to hear the woman explain that her chicken...well...it didn't taste like chicken. The waitress feigned surprise before asking: \"Does it taste like freezer burn?\" \"Yes!\"\n\nFACE PALM. \n\nWhen my boyfriend went up to settle the bill, he was started to find my meal on the bill. Upon asking if she could do something with it given my circumstances, she sighed heavily and said she'd have to consult with the kitchen staff. She returned two minutes later and said: \"I can give you 15% off.\" My boyfriend now agitated by this response rebuttled that I hadn't even consumed even half of my meal.\" \"Well, she ate the fries, right? I'll just charge her for those.\" $4.99 on cardboard French fries later... and we were racing for the door with a mutual agreement to never return again. \n\nWild Wing, there is a reason why a number of your establishments are closing, it's only a matter of time before you, your crappy chicken and plastic china at this location follow.", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "nWijf_A0YjLSAmSrB1Nt8A"}

The blue moonshine night cheese dipping for my daughter's fries is a smooth texture and just right flavour which even my wife loves that.  I think Wild Wing's wing has a quality on food in average.  Portion is ok compare to its price level.  They have kids menu and the portion is just right.\n\nOnly thing I am not quite satisfy which I can tell is the service it provide with the price.  I mean the service from getting reception to table.  The waiter told us it is around 15 min but I have waited 25 to 30min but actually the place is not that full at that time.  Well, it is me and my son's birthday, so I don't want to ruin the time.   Wait time on the food is not fast but I am patient enough along with my smartphone.\n\nPlace are big, clean but definitely a sport bar is quite noisy for family but good for a big group over 10.  Be sure you reserves for table otherwise you will be frustrated unless you want to sit in the bar side.\n\nI think I am one of the kindest about the reviews.  I cannot say Wild Wing is very bad in food, but service wise, it needs to be improved in order impress people to come back for a second visit.  Or unless they have a very good price or food quality or speciality, otherwise, it is even hard to impress a not-so-demand guy to come back a second time.", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "dKCIizJqCJzF-OdbLEWBCQ"}

The space is cheery and bright during the daytime and smooth and romantic in the evening for their new dinner menu. I've been a faithful daytime attendant for weekend brunch, weekday lunch, a coffee and a pastry-fuelled afternoon of work... I've always absolutely loved my experiences with their unbelievably friendly and attentive staff and their delicious food.\n\nThey hit it out of the park with their farçous (spinach pancakes) and omelettes, both of which I keep coming back to. I've also loved their tartiflette (potato/cheese tart) and the healthy bites I've had sharing plates of the kravitz, the ploughman, the gravlax... Basically I'm a well-meaning mooch, and my partner and I regularly wind up splitting our plates because everything is so tempting. Most of their meals come with a perfectly composed salad with mixed greens, thinly sliced radishes and a beautifully light vinaigrette and then their phenomenal potato salad...  Possibly the best I've ever had. It's definitely a step up from something you'd have at a BBQ. Everything is just really delicately balanced and flavoured just right.\n\nSince they just launched their dinner menu, I've only tried it once, but it was one of the best meals I've ever had. Finding a decent and well-priced steak is a real difficult task in Toronto, but BIVY has it down. Their entrecôte steak frites comes with a grilled 10 oz rib eye prepared at a perfect medium rare as requested and covered in an understated herbed butter, fries that are seasoned just right and done to the perfect crisp without being overcooked and, of course, that beautiful simple salad. For $18.95! Pair it with one of their well-priced glasses of wine and you have the perfect date night. We'll be back again soon, probably tacking on an order of mussels to start since they look SO good.\n\nI know I'm just gushing at this point. I just really love this place and it's the perfect local spot. It's equal parts cafe, brunch/lunch stop and great dinner option. A lot of restaurants wouldn't be able to juggle all those identities, but BIVY is great at doing simple, delicious food and providing a versatile ambiance with great service.

The interior is pretty much on par with most of the other restaurants that have popped up in this area in the last couple years, with reclaimed wood interiors with small candlelit tables. \n\nWe started with the charcuterie and spicy devilled eggs to start. Both were tasty and appropriately priced, but the devilled eggs were admittedly not actually spicy. Still tasty, but adding a dusting of paprika is hardly spicy to me. Then as a second course we split an order of ribs, which were decent, but a little to overpowering in the citrus based acidity. \nAs a main, I rounded out my meal with the pulled pork sandwich with fries. The pulled pork was admittedly less acidic than the ribs and more savoury. The spinach in the sandwich was a nice addition but the tomato and mayo just made me realize the flavor of the pork isn't impressive enough if relying on additional sauces and juicy vegetables to affect its flavouring. \n\nIn the end for 4 beers, the 2 apps, an order of ribs and 2 mains came in a bit over $100 after tax and tip.

I agreed, then looked it up and was horrified by the reviews, and fearful of food poisoning. I told my friend that I would like to go conditionally--we could pop our heads in and if it looked okay, we could stay.\n\nIt looked okay, when checked out the place--maybe a little unpleasant, in that some of the tables were uncleared and so on, but this might just have been busyness. It was pretty full, with only a couple of seats going to spare. The woman who seated us seemed curt and sullen, however, there was a man who served our table for the most part (the woman refilled our tea once). The man was friendly, smiling and helpful.\n\nWe went for AYCE. And it was fine. I didn't get food poisoning, which always raises my rating of a restaurant where raw fish is served by one star.*\n\nSo it was fine. And the rolls were... fine. The ones made for us last night didn't look like they were made by a \"blindfolded 8 year old cutting with a hacksaw\" (as another reviewer eloquently put it--perhaps a different sushi chef, or else she encountered she same sushi chef as we did, but at the beginning of his career, and how he's in that mid-career slump). On the other hand, perhaps that would have made them more interesting, at least visually? They were pretty standard AYCE, generally. Taste-wise, they were fine, but not fabulous. Each piece of my dynamite roll was too big to manage in one bite, and we all know that this makes for some messiness, as you have to do it in two bites, the flavours don't blend the same way, and unless you're that special combination of skilled and lucky, it falls apart while your'e chewing your first bite. But it was fine. Nothing to write home about (home being Vancouver, where sushi is generally yum and less uneven than the stuff out here, it seems).\n\nOne special note is the spicy salmon roll. Last summer at a sushi place on the Danforth whose name I do not recall, a friend warned us away from the spicy rolls. He said that they use crappy cuts of fish and disguise it with the spicy sauce. I had never heard of such a thing--we often have sushi out in Waterloo (as we live there part time), and it has always been fine--the same cut of fish as the regular roll, with some spicy sauce drizzled over.\n\nLast night, I saw what my friend meant. The spicy salmon roll featured finely chopped salmon, mixed with the spicy sauce--and closer examination confirmed that yes, the lighter stuff in the chopped meat side was not merely sauce, but also fatty, less appealing bits. I tried a bite and this reinforced my friend's warning, which I now pass on to you, with the note that at least for now, in Waterloo, this is not the case. There, the spicy rolls are not crappy cuts of meat disguised by spice. But sadly, at least some AYCE places here, no doubt faced with higher overhead and fierce competition, seem to have decided to take short cuts where they can least afford to--on the food itself, while hoping that the flat rate AYCE pricing will make up for it. The fact that I won't rush back to this place indicates that at least for me, the pricing doesn't make up for it--I'd rather have a tasty bento box, well-prepared, than such mediocre AYCE. \n\n*I think my rating would more accurately (from the descriptions) be \"meh--I've had better\" because this is precisely true. But, most people seem to be writing really horrid reviews alongside their two star ratings, so I assume that 2 stars is actually more negative than that and three stars is more of a \"meh\" in practice.

We were promptly served our tea and water when we sat down, and the two waitressess tag-teamed our table returning multiple times through the meal to top up both types of drinks.\n\nWe came for the All You Can Eat (AYCE) dinner on a moderately busy Saturday night - there may have been 4 or 5 other tables being served along with us. On the weekends, the price is apparently raised by $1, so instead of it being $15.99 now, it's $16.99 on a Saturday (and I can only assume that applied to Friday and Sunday as well). (note: they did have the \"lower\" menu for $12.99 weekend price, but my buddy said that one doesn't come with Sashimi, so we went with the higher priced one.\n\nThe sushi was good. It wasn't great (I lived in Vancouver and have had GREAT sushi back in the day) but in my opinion it wasn't gross as some have suggested by any means. The presentation on our plates was also nice, as our multiple rolls and sashimi came out nicely presented (and our white salmon sashimi - which comes in thin strips - was presented looking like the flower of a rose, a beautifully artistic interpretation that I hadn't seen before.)\n\nSashimi was quite good. Nice and fresh. No complaints. Sushi rolls do come with a lot of rice, but they were tasty too. They had a few rolls I'd never seen before like the \"Excellent Role\" (I know, how awesome of a name is that!) which was shrimp and banana. My girlfriend and I felt adventurous and tried it and it worked really well in our opinion.\n\nOn the AYCE menu there was only 1 dessert, tempura friend Banana, which they pour a little chocolate over, and it was actually quite tasty. When we finished, they also offered us complimentary ice cream (Green Tea or Coconut flavours).\n\nOverall, this place wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I've had better sushi, but I was spoiled living a few years on the west coast. The AYCE menu is pretty thorough with lots of choice, and the price is decent. I've not had much Sushi yet in Toronto since moving here, but this place was pretty good for what you got.\n\nI want to say 3.5 stars, but that's not an rating option in Yelp, so this restaurant will benefit from the automatic round-up to 4-stars.", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "pHMEXcu8OtnlVp7iNRBA6w"}

For $16.99 all-you-can-eat, we didn't have any high expectations of the food quality. We just wanted to be full and be merry.\n\nFood was average-below average but enough to satisfy. Tempura was never crispy (and if you think that's an undercooked yam tempura, no, it's just carrot.) The salmon sashimi was probably the only highlight of our night, though they were poorly deboned.\n\nBut oh, did we wait... I think we came in at 9:30PM and our first order didn't come in until 10:20ish. There were only three other tables. It was like this with all our orders until closing time. I guess on the bright side, we finally paced ourselves at AYCE and there were a set of flies that entertained us as we tried to keep them off of our chopsticks.\n\nService though? Really bad. Like, I don't think I've ever been this baffled by service in my life especially since my entire family (also Chinese) works in the restaurant scene. To start off, we were handed two sheets for AYCE but no pen/pencil. No plates for anything until we asked for them during our second order. Water has no ice and was lukewarm. I would not be surprised if it was like those restaurant stories my parents tell of places that rinse utensils in drinking water. Ha..\n\nCommunicating with the staff is terrible. They're always in a rush (to not serve the other customers) and were really condescending. I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt especially if English is not they're first language when it comes to tone (since I understand this issue having interacted with so many ESL Chinese) but no... the staff is just plain grumpy 24/7. \n\nWe were charged an extra ~$4 due to some miscommunication and after waiting for our waitress's 20 minute phone call to end, we flagged her down. We disputed this charge but instead of rectifying this issue (sounds familiar to some other yelp reviews?!) they asked why we even bothered coming here instead of the other AYCEs on Bloor. W-what? We were willing to pay the extra charge since it was a misunderstanding on both ends and it was only $4 but the immediate lashing out that occurred from wanting to get the situation clarified was downright unnecessary. They eventually removed the charge and we even *tipped* them (something I will regret to this day.) I was even more put off by how fiercely the waitress grabbed the money off of the table sans the tray by slamming her palm down on the bills and then clenching them in a fist while I was in the middle of exiting the booth..\n\nTo those that still want to try Mariko's AYCE for their first time and to those that will unknowingly walk in like we did, stay safe.", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "vZgoRyiEeNzlTyyWyrpJ-w"}

Well  when i went to pay they wanted to charge us 17.99, even though all of the banners say 10.99.  After a brief argument the one waitress called the manager on the phone screaming in Japanese  and finally charged us 10.99, still insisting she told us when we ordered that we were getting the more expensive menu??  SHE DID NOT....  This is where it gets good...  she than yells at me saying Im never welcome again.. I said fine...this is the worst sushi I have ever had and I wouldn't dream of coming back..she than barked  at me again.   At this point I had enough and told her where to go, at which point the waitress turned around and slapped me in the face twice  YES  she actually physically assaulted me!!!   But it didnt stop there!  She then shoved me into a table...After this I unleashed hell fire on her and ran out.

I know there is supposed to be rice on sushi, I'm not freaking out over carbs. This was out of hand. There was hardly any fish in the rolls!

It's creamier consistency is better for some rolls, but not sashimi. \n\nThe severs were nice, but very difficult to communicate with.

I'm not expecting fast food, but at least bring out the first roll or two within 15 minutes.\n\n\n***The lesson here: you get what you pay for. ***\nThis place is about 30% cheaper than other AYCE sushi restaurants in the area, and the quality of the food is at least 30% lower.

They always seem to have some sort of special on, which is great for students.  They have a $10.99 AYCE menu (albeit VERY limited), and a $14.99 AYCE which includes sashimi (2 or 3 types).  They also have \"FREE DAYS\", where each day of the week, you get something free with your meal (ie. tofu & miso on Sundays).\n\nBoth times I have been there, service has been brutal.  There were times that the waitress was just sitting at a table with her head down, and one of the chefs would come over to serve us after our failed attempts to get her attention.\n\nThe first visit, I ordered à la carte, and the food came out beautifully prepared and displayed.  (see picture I will be uploading)\nThe second visit, which was AYCE, it was as though they couldn't care less.  It was all just laid on a big plate in rows.  The salmon sashimi came out in super thin slices, yet all still stuck together by some fatty tissue at the corner.  I have never seen sashimi cut so poorly in my life!  And the fish just did not seem like sushi grade.  I was so disgusted, I didn't re-order anything but basic rolls.  But even the spicy salmon roll was purely mushy, and it appeared that the chef hadn't cleaned his prep area between preparing rolls.  Rolls that weren't supposed to have fish eggs on them had a few scattered bits of tobiko around the outside, that clearly didn't come from just being on the plate.  It's so important for sushi chefs to use clean surfaces when preparing different rolls or fish.   For a second time, I was disgusted.\n\nThe interior is a cold blue, and the lighting is just as unwelcoming.  I think they've installed fluorescent lighting panels on the walls, and put transparent images of bamboo over them, as if they could act as sconces.  FAIL\n\nWe overheard a diner behind us asking the waitress to recommend something delicious he hadn't tried before, and she suggested the dynamite roll.  I couldn't believe it.  The customer looked pretty disappointed too.  If I had to rank the million sushi places on Bloor, Mariko would be wayyy down on my list.  If you're going to try it, my only advice is not to go for the AYCE.  It's just not worth it in the end if you can't enjoy your meal.  Part of the joy of sushi is the presentation and preparation.  It should be a feast for the eyes as well, and Mariko seems to think that it's alright to offer an inferior meal to their AYCE customers.\n\nLater found out they had a conditional pass back in April '09.

The continental breakfast only included the cold section of the break (breads, fruits and croissant...) but we chose to to add $6 for hot buffet because the croissants and fruits had obviously been left for several days (no jokes, the croissant had a kind of fermenting smell to it) and spoiled. \n\n3. Fine... so off we go to the hot buffet (the selection was very LIMITED) but we thought how can we go wrong with $6 buffet? WRONG! The scramble eggs was blah and the bacons tasted like it'd been several days old...\n\nWell, I can go on and on about how bad this place is but I won't... You probably get the idea anyway... Stay away from this place since there are so many choices (and MUCH better) right outside the steps of this hotel (Tim Horton's, Kelsey's, Subway, Milestones, Sushi, Swiss Chalet and etc...).", "type": "review", "useful": 4, "user_id": "x2jghNDhObRgtvaybya2dQ"}

The chocolate cake we had for dessert was very good.\n\nThe service itself was pretty weak.

They might have two locations.  The one we visited was on 410 Place Jaques.  We were in the Old Montreal part of town on Saturday June 8 looking for a spot to eat.  It was the Grand Prix week-end so naturally a lot of places were full.  It was fairly chilly outside and drizzling and we had been walking for close to two hours looking at various places and menus.  \n\nFinally we came upon this place and it looked very quaint, with a full patio and outside heaters.  The maitre'd greeted us and informed us that their specialty was seafood, all fresh.  I love seafood so we were sold.  Went to sit inside since we were cold and wet, but as soon as went it, we started questioning our decision.  The place was dated, and not nearly as busy as the patio.  There was also a foul fryer mixed with rotting fish smell so we decided to move outside.\n\nwe ordered the calamary which was chewy, yellow and tasted old, and the snails which there were only 4 of and no bigger than the ones you get at the keg.  They were covered in cheese and mushrooms (of which there was no mention of on the menu but i happen to like mushrooms so i did not complain).\n\nOn to mains.  Since they touted that they were known for their seafood i ordered the muscles and my partner ordered the fillet mignon.  Both were awful.  the filet tasted as if had been in the fridge for over 3 weeks - tough with a weird spongy time of texture, and very bad flavour.  The muscles were not fresh and many did not open during the cooking process.  The broth - the little that existed - had no flavour other than overly salty.\n\nVERDICT:::\nvery pricey, food quality sub par, service left much to be desired. I am surprised we did not get sick.

It was also completely empty despite there being hoardes of people in local competitors.\n\nService started out a bit weird. I asked if they had iced coffee (not on the menu) and the server replied: ''I could make you one I suppose''....Odd. Anyway, I ordered an iced latte as well the french toast with fruit and my bf ordered the croque monsieur.\n\nI went to wash my hands and noticed how dark and dirty the corridors leading into the kitchen were. The bathroom stank!! Then I saw someone, who I later found out was the manager, walking from the storage area to the kitchen with my french toast in a see through plastic bag. I then saw him put it in a microwave in the grotty kitchen. $11. French toast. MICROWAVED?!\n\nStupidly, I gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and didn't say anything. My iced latte arrived. It had espresso, and cold milk, topped off with HOT FROTH and NO ICE. Seriously? Not only is that disgusting, it's also dangerous - hot and cold milk should never be mixed. When I worked at Starbucks this was the first thing we were taught - never accommodate any customer who wants hot foam on an iced espresso drink. It tasted horrible and the server seemed confused when I asked for a mug of ice to help make the drink actually, yknow, ICED.\n\nThe food arrived. The french toast was as gross as it looked in that plastic bag. It was soggy, flat and worst of all - STALE. the watermelons that came with it would have needed a steak knife to cut. My bf is NOT a fussy eater, but took one bite into his sorry looking croque madame (think microwaved ham and cheese on white bread) and said ''do you want to just leave?''. We were both that appalled. We eat out a lot, and have travelled a lot, eating in all sorts of restaurants, and this was the first time either of us ever left any restaurant anywhere because we were so disgusted with the food quality.\n\nWhat was most interesting was that neither the servers nor the manager were particularly shocked when we said we were leaving and refused to pay. They didn't even protest, offer us anything else or defend themselves for charging $11 for microwaved french toast. After asking us for a bit of clarification, they simply said ''sorry, ok'' and shrugged their shoulders.

Super long wait at the non-crowded bar while I had the pleasure of watching the male bartender flirt with the female waitstaff for over 5 minutes. No acknowledgement or apologies from the staff for severely sub-par service. \n\nDetailed review: The service is just plain awful. I've been a few times now before deciding to finalize my opinion and write a review, and after my last visit this past weekend I'm compelled to warn people to stay away if you're looking for a place with anything resembling even mediocre service. I stood at the bar (dead center, with no one standing in front of me) for over 5 minutes before the bartender even took my order. It was not busy, and there is no excuse for the wait - I had to watch the male bartender flirt and laugh with the female waitstaff the entire time. He never made eye contact or even bothered to acknowledge my presence the entire time I waited. When he finally came over, it was after he took the order and brought beers for the guy who stood next to me, and had only just recently ponied up to the bar about a minute previously. When I finally got my drink order (a very simple whisky cocktail and a draught PBR) the cocktail ended up being one of the worst I've ever had in my life. I don't understand how someone could mess up a simple cocktail so badly - I even asked a few friends to try it to make sure I wasn't overreacting. Their disgusted looks after they each took a sip proved me right. My experiences at this place in the past were warning enough, but after this last visit I will never go back.", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "LY9sHT0o7Uc4qCMu6ze6Gg"}

That wasn't even the worst part. \n\nWent here for a free show--a touring band from Norway. The band was good, sound was good, vibe was good--until I walked up to the bar. I appeared to be interrupting something when I walked up. I then asked the female bartender how much the well drinks were and she said $5 as if she was already annoyed with me. I then asked her what a buckshot was (since that was the $1 special on the board.) She didn't have a straight answer and instead asked the male bartender, \"it's uh whatever we feel like making, we'll start with whiskey?\" \n\nI ordered it, what the hell, YOLO. Big mistake--the \"buckshot\" tasted like cough medicine and corn syrup. \n\nBefore my order was complete the male and female bartender are snickering with each other as if they are sharing their own private joke. I seriously felt like I was transported back to middle school--who does that? I got the feeling that these two weren't happy with the crowd nor the band--but that shouldn't really matter. The crowd was there drinking (and tipping) these two because of the band. Why the attitude? \n\nBefore the band's set was over the male bartender starts cleaning up the venue, pushing chairs in (loudly) and collecting glasses from tables. The lead singer says into the microphone \"are we being kicked out?\" to which she gets no response. The male bartender and female bartender appeared to be flirting with one another in the back corner, laughing at customers, etc. I definitely wasn't the only one that was feeling uncomfortable. These two bartenders were not only chasing the crowd away but also the headlining band. \n\nThe venue itself had a cool vibe (aside from the nu-metal blaring in between sets), the prices were slightly more than average ($5 for a draft beer, $5 for a well drink, $1 for a \"buckshot\") and the service, well the service was non-existence. I felt like the duo was put out by my presence. Word of advice if you are the duo reading this--if your income is highly dependent upon tips, you should probably be nicer to the 20 or so people that are actually in your bar on a Monday night instead of driving them (and the band they came to see) away.", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "7bqF4CAxqYhDzxumrBkL4Q"}

We had never been, so when we arrived at 7:00 we thought the doors would be open to serve food, but when they say doors open and 7:30, they open at 7:30. As we were waiting outside, 7:30 rolled around and we were told the doors would be opening at 7:45 instead. Okay, fine, we were hungry but we could wait. 7:45, doors didn't open. 8:00, doors didn't open. Finally around 8:15, 15 minutes after the show was suppose to start we got in and we grabbed one of the first tables we saw, right at the front near the stage. \n\nWe sat down and were handed menus pretty quickly. A waitress came around and asked if we'd been helped, we said no and ordered a Coke (which was 90% ice) and PBR. We then mentioned that we'd be ordering food tonight. Then about a minute later another waitress came over and asked if we'd been helped, we said yes and assumed they a communication or organizational issue. About 5 minutes later a bartender brought over our drinks and we started noticing food being brought out to the booths behind us. We overheard the people behind us get asked if they wanted food to eat twice, yet our waitress walked right by us. We tried several times to flag someone down, but the opening band had already begun to play so it was difficult to get anyone's attention. \n\nAfter being ready for 15 minutes, and watching everyone else get their food orders, our waitress came back and we finally got our order in. I don't remember the specifics but we got the grilled cheese and a burger. We got our food about 5 minutes later, which was okay, nothing special. At that point we were so hungry would have been happy if they just brought us over some Taco Bell. About halfway through the meal, we both ran out of drinks, down to the last drop of watered down Coke. We began another round of find your waitress as our food got cold. And once again she walked past a few times. After about 5 minutes of trying I just gave up and walked over to the end of the bar with my empty glass. Our waitress walked over to the bar and since the bartender was busy I asked her for another Coke and PBR. She replied with a cheery, \"Sure! I'll bring that right over!\" I guess she didn't find it strange that I was trying to get my own refill. She brought over our drinks and we finished our meal. Then the fastest service we got was her bringing us the bill. \n\nMaybe we picked a bad table. Maybe we picked a hectic night.

J'aime beaucoup, personnellement, les röstis, galettes de pommes de terre rapées, agrémentées de fromage, d'olive, de tomate, de bacon, ou autre selon celle que l'on choisit.  Ils font aussi d'excellentes pancakes à l'avoine.  Les portions sont généreuses et les prix très convenables.\n\nPourquoi pas une étoile de plus alors ?\n\nParce qu'ils ne savent pas faire un expresso convenable (et c'est vraiment le MOINS qu'on puisse dire).  Évitez tout ce qui ressemble à un expresso, cappucino, café au lait  en cet endroit (en tous cas, si vous aimez le café).  À titre d'exemple, quand j'ai commandé un expresso double très très court, on m'a apporté une bonne demi-tasse d'eau de vaisselle.  On m'a expliqué que c'était le plus court que la machine pouvait faire...  Merde, c'est au moins 8 fois trop d'eau!  Changez de machine!\nLeur filtre, quoique manquant un peu de concentration, est bon à sa façon.  Vaut mieux s'en tenir à ça...\n\nMais tout de même, pour un resto à déjeuner, ne pas pouvoir faire un café décent...", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "XZIpNI9QjSWtnmlGLy9AVQ"}

Ya kind of but with what kind of customers? Definitely majority of there customers don't have Turkish or let's say Armenian backgrounds , they cater to low budget middle eastern immigrants most of them from 3rd world country's where they don't have any idea what Turkish food is . \nPeople who reads our reviews will see that so far we don't have 1 good review about Turkish restaurants in Ontario and Quebec , that's because we travel to Istanbul 4 to 6 times a year and we really know what Turkish kebab is  unfortunately there is not one decent Turkish kebab restaurant specially in Quebec .\nPlace looks like a old Middleastern mosque with all green walls , and the music that you hear while you eat? Omg in Turkish we say (AGIT) meaning? Sad crying song when someone dies this is the kind of music they listen at uncivilized Turkish villages. Before I forget Shepard salad , ezme are sitting on the counter( not in the fridge) yes on the counter covered with Saran Wrap so it does not get dirty , you have to eat warm Shepard salad that's unfortunate :))))) \nIs the place clean yes it is but then again that does not make the food good, \nIam hoping 1 day In Montreal we will have a good Turkish kebab restaurants like Toronto or New York but I have no hopes ,why I don't have hopes?

The area of the restaurant and indeed the area where I live is plagued by the economy.  We are a neighborhood of the haves and the have-nots.

So if you must eat here, bring a coupon or the bill will somewhat infuriate you due to the wholly unexceptional food.  Without a coupon expect to pay 15-20% more than a Dennys or Village Inn for about the same food.\n\nOn the bright side, I have had lunch here several times and really enjoyed the Reuben, so there is at least one sandwich that has some flavor and was not a dissapointment.

Two bars full bars, one indoor and one indoor/outdoor. The indoor bar is in between the main entrance and the dining room. The indoor/outdoor is to the left of the entrance away from the rest of the restaurant. The indoor/outdoor bar has booths with personal TV's, an \"O\" shaped bar with plenty of big screen TV's, and roll up doors which are open on nice nights leading to the outdoor patio. The place is very nice and clean. Very nice look and upkeep\n\nDrink: Great beer selection. They have a long list of beer on tap which includes your normal domestics, seasonal beers, and micro brews. Most places do not have this selection which is amazing for people who enjoy this type of selection. PLUS, they have a two full bars for people who love liquor. \n\nFood: Food has changed since the name has changed and the business is under new management. The menu is similar but not quiet the same and they have rid the menu of many of the items that I liked. They have a good variety consisting of steak, chicken, sea food, burgers, and homemade pizzas. Overall the food is decent but not as good as it used to be. \n\nAtmosphere: Great overall. Dining room and inside bar are a good casual family area. The Indoor/Outdoor bar is separate and has more of a casual bar feel to it. Great place for any occasion and for sports games. \n\nStaff: Overall they are not bad but they are certainly not great either. Some of the waiters/waitresses are good and some not so much. All of them are friendly however some seem very new while others are veterans in the food service. The service is very inconsistent. More consistency would go a long way. \n\nOverall: Good but not great. I miss the Indoor/Outdoor bar being open more often. It really gave the place a different dimension and a more causal relaxing feel that nowhere else really offers during nice days. I also miss the homemade dressings, specialty pizzas, BBQ sauce, and custom burgers. Sure they offer these things but they are not the same as before. I like the place and will go there occasionally but not as much as before.

Sure, it was game-time, opening weekend of the NFL season, but the place wasn't packed.  Most of the patrons were seated in either of the two bar areas.

Brewstone Beer Company was one of those dynamite experiences that just put smiles on our faces.  An extremely large location with about four main dining areas and multiple bars, Brewstone not only serves up their own blends of house-brewed ale; but offers an array of mind-blowing food!  Right off the bat I was thrilled when they nailed my signature drink, The Brimstone Red - sweet and perfect!  Then they brought out this inconceivable platter of their Brewstone Signature Nachos that was utterly astonishing... never before have I been this floored with the MASSIVE size and flavor behavior of... well - Nachos.  Big enough for a hungry couple or a group, it was off the chain with tri-colored tortilla chips, fresh avocado, jack and cheddar cheese, house chili... should I go on?  We opted for all three meats: grilled chicken, steak and BBQ pulled pork to top our serving.  It came out piled-high with large chunks of chicken that had intense flavor and was moist, juicy and delish.  LOVED the sweet and tangy, smoky BBQ pork that was off the charts - total fan.  As for the steak... sweet and unbelievable!  Best nachos EVER in Food Hound history to date.\n\nThe Seared Ahi Tuna again blew my mind... Sashimi grade Ahi Tuna coated with black and white sesame seeds; the presentation was enticing - thick and meaty slices, cool and refreshing, fresh and fantasmic!  I thoroughly enjoyed their wasabi mousse - sweet and spicy with flavor that just makes you want more - WIN!  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were simple and divine; lettuce, chicken, wontons and carrots with a BOSS ginger soy sauce that enhances the taste of the whole shebang.  Something new that we've never experienced before was the Tri-Colored Cheese Sticks - the BIG difference is the use of cheddar as opposed to the typical mozzarella; but aside from the obvious... they utilize crushed tri-color tortilla chips in the batter used to coat the cheese before frying!  So fantastic and unique - they are paired with a spicy marinara and crispy onion straws for good measure.  Of course we had to try the Mac & Cheese - a hefty helping of over four cheeses co-mingling with penne, then topped with big chunks of luscious chicken to create a hot, steamy mini-meal (make sure every bite has some chicken).  The Corn Chowder had a chunky consistency of potatoes and corn with just a hint of seasoning with a bit of a kick to pop your taste buds.\n\nThe entrees cometh... we enjoyed a Tex-Mex Sandwich which was an overwhelming roller coaster of zesty flavor - juicy chicken offers an even keel on this sandwich; the pepper jack and jalapeno gives a spicy kick that is counteracted by the avocado adding a fresh cooling effect. The Shrimp Alfredo's flavor is ka-pow... big, juicy shrimp doused in an intense alfredo sauce - a hefty serving for a hungry critter!  Another big deal at Brewstone is their signature pizza - the Meatball Pizza was a solid and delicious pie; the meatballs were large, chunky and offered a great rendition of an old classic.  I almost passed out after the first bite of the Pulled Pork BBQ Pizza as it was orgasmic!  Sweet, smoky and explosive - stacked with fresh corn, their unreal pulled BBQ pork and delectable caramelized onions... full of cheese with a killer flavor.  Beautiful, bountiful... absurdly GREAT!  Lastly, the Chicken Madeira was like eating a Thanksgiving dinner; but with chicken- creamy mashed potatoes and sautéed green beans that were juicy, fresh and crunchy!  The chicken itself was tender and tucked into the plate with a thick blanket of mozzarella cheese and then drowned in heavenly gravy.  Everything was incredible from the food to the service and the environment itself; this is certainly not a place to be missed.  We'll be sure to pop in next time we're in town - especially for those nachos... Hmm... if I leave now...", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "MnTF124Hq3tE6zMeReceyg"}

Burger was overdone and not very juicy, and they left off the bacon and lettuce and tomatoes were smaller than the burger--not what you expect for a $11 burger.\n\nWife orders an ahi tuna salad vinaigrette on the side. Tuna was definitely cooked in the morning and refrigerated. It was dried out and scaly and they put the dressing on the salad anyways and put a second side of dressing. The dressing was unbelievably strong in vinegar flavor. So strong that my wife asked to take the tuna and have them just provide new greens. One fork dip in the dressing was strong enough. $16 worth of salad that was really something you expect to get at a luxury vending machine.\n\nBeer was good, but she could have mentioned that they had a very limited draft list and that what I was ordering was a bottle.

The \"beer experience\" is severely lacking as the \"beer menu\" was very confusing.  Instead of telling you what beer is what, the menu and the wait staff give you a vague, general idea of what beer you are going to get, such as a \"citrusy, hoppy beer,\" (which equates to an IPA) or a \"dark, sweet beer,\" (a stout).  Being a minor beer snob, I found the process bewildering as I had to guess at what I was going to get.  They should just tell you it's a \"Stone IPA,\" or \"Founder's Breakfast Stout,\" instead of letting you \"guess.\"\n\nStrike two:  The service was less than stellar.  Again, this may have improved, but after we ordered our drinks,  the waitress said she couldn't find the bartender, so there was a delay.  Our waitress (a very young woman) seemed to really be trying, but it seemed like she wasn't trained very well.  \n\nStrike three:  The food, again wasn't great.  I got a burger and it was so-so.  My wife was mad that she didn't even get a piece of bread with her salad.  Our 2 friends weren't impressed either.  I spoke to someone else who ate there and they really liked the food, so maybe it was what we ordered..... dunno.\n\nOverall, we were disappointed and underwhelmed.... and we really wanted to like the place.... there aren't too many places in Monroeville that I really like.

Both were good. Pints of craft beer were $3.50 on the night I came, but not sure if that was an opening week special or the normal price.\n\nI have a couple of things to call out:\n1) For a place called Brewstone, and with craft beers all the rage, the draft beer selection is weak. I counted 20 different draft beers, most of which are available anywhere you go (Bud Lite, Sam Adams, etc.) I expected a wider selection of craft brews on tap.\n2) I would expect a place that has made such an enormous investment in audio / video equipment would likewise invest in sports programming. I'm sure they'll have the NFL Ticket package, but come on guys, throw us a bone and get the MLB package for the summer. On this night, the Pirates had played during the day and so virtually every tv was showing ESPN programming. I can stay home a see that.\n\nDon't come for the culinary experience.

With his broken english he refused any refund or exchange transaction....I thought to myself...all this for what... for his poorly made product?

In a city known for smoked meat and french fries loaded with gravy and cheese I had one of the best meals ever at Propulsion Cantine Vegetalienne. A Vegan restaurant  with an Airplane theme on the famed Saint Catherine's Street.  From the menu to the decor, from the waitress to the owner, this place is funky, fresh and entirely unexpected. Simone and I brought some friends with us who were Vegan and we actually arrived about twenty minutes before closing. I was a little nervous that the service and the food would be sub par because of the time of night but we were happily greeted on arrival by the quirky and funky waitress whose name I cant remember but whose personality I can never forget. She was more then willing to talk our ears off about the entire menu and about their new restaurant that has only been open since mid summer 2013.  The decor is aviation themed including a mannequin of a 1950's pilot and many parts of an actual propeller plane that had crashed and the owner had bought and turned into the bar and some seating tables.  It is all very cool to look at while waiting for the food.  Speaking of food, we decided after speaking with the waitress that we would just let her decide what to eat and so she started us off with a sample of a cool and refreshing cucumber smoothie. From there the four of us split a create your own bowl.  This was a imaginative concept where you choose a combination of grains, vegetables, and sauces. We went with a Pesto Bowl and had Quinoa, Bean Based Pesto, and fresh grilled Zucchini and roasted Cauliflower in it. Although completely dairy free, and thickened with garbanzo beans, this was the best Pesto I have had. It was creamy, nutty and garlicky great. The quinoa and vegetables were cooked perfectly as well and this was a great start to the meal.  Next we wanted to explore the sandwich menu (all sandwiches come with tempeh in them and of course your choice of fresh, moist, light vegan breads) .They all sounded so good our waitress suggested we split a variety of them and she would be sure the kitchen would cut them into portions for us. I didn't think it would get much better after the Pesto but these sandwiches were just over the top great.  The choices we went with were the Lentil Cari sandwich ( my personal favorite), The Mungo Mango ( voted by my friends to be the best), and The Purple Taro Portabello (still good but third on the voting scale). The Lentil Sandwich on Turmeric Bread was tempeh with a lentil patty that had a hint of curry and spice and just the right amount of smokiness, The patty held together on the outside and when you bit in the lentils were cooked perfectly tender but not mushy.  I have never had lentils that tasted so good in my culinary life and the only thing that upset me about this sandwich was that I had to share it with the rest of the table. It was my absolute favorite. Next up was the Mungo Mango. This was also pretty good and consisted of Chinese Mung Beans and Fresh Mango's  with tempeh on Fig Bread...It was earthy and sweet and everyone at the table loved it also. Lastly was the Purple Taro Portabello.  It was also good (and very purple) with mashed taro and sauteed mushrooms with tempeh but I found it to be a little soggy and less flavorful then the other sandwiches.  By the time we ate all the food it was past closing but when we asked the waitress if she wanted to cash us out to help with closing she told us not to worry about it and then she went and ate her own dinner.  We ended up staying for awhile longer and chatting amongst ourselves and with her and it was only when the kitchen (and pilot outfitted owner) had started to leave that we got our check. On the way out we took some vegan cookies with us for the road and they of course were great.  That night I dreamed of Lentil Sandwiches and so the next night Simone and I went back for another helping of sandwiches, pesto and good conversation with our friendly waitress. There was also a great piano player that second night who was amazing and we ended up staying again until closing. Everything about Propulsion is five stars, in the future they will be adding Vegan alcoholic drinks and fresh local salads. I hope that people check this place out because it truly is a hidden gem and I hope that I will have the pleasure of many return visits when I travel to Montreal.", "type": "review", "useful": 2, "user_id": "jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q"}

I asked for the bill immediately, and when he returned with it later, he told me he had removed the offending item so that we wouldn't be charged.\n\nListen... I just chomped down on a piece of machinery and it hurt. Don't think you're being some generous prince by knocking the thing off the bill. I gave him less money than the total -- basically enough to cover the drinks -- and told him that's all he was getting. Again, no reaction.\n\nHere's where I tell you that the menu sucks; the crab cakes taste like they came from MM Meatshop; the stale olives in the martini tasted like aluminium. The only saving grace was the readily available boxes of Trivial Pursuit cards, which quickly lost their novelty.\n\nThis is what concerns me most: we came here because people on Yelp said it was decent.

They serve top-notch pub fare alongside some quality beers (but needs to be more seasonal, lagers and pale ales just don't satisfy in the dead of winter and they were out of the oatmeal stout. nb: Guinness in a can doesn't count as stout, or a beer for that matter) and just happened to fit my craving for comfort food on a really cold night perfectly.\n\nI had a wonderful meal starting with their delicious butternut squash crab cakes, which were served with a scotch bonnet aioli that had no scotch bonnet in it.  While it was a puzzling omission, it was a lovely starter. For my supremely comfortable entree, I had the beef bourguignon, which was a hearty stew of button mushrooms, thick-cut carrots, cippolini onions and tender chunks of beef with what the chef likes to call \"pear mashed potatoes\".  This blew me away when it was served, and I thought it was unique, clever and bloody delicious. They take a heaping mound of mashed and shape it like a giant pear, and then quickly deep fry it, and top it with a whole clove as the stem. I had to smile and marvel at its elegant construction before I hungrily devoured my plate. I splurged on some sticky toffee pudding for dessert as the meal was so perfectly hitting all of my gastrogenous zones, and it did not disappoint. It was a large piece and while they were a bit light on the caramel sauce, my waistline didn't need any more abuse on this particular occasion. Everything was perfect, and it was just what I needed on a windy and oh-so-cold night. \n\nThe atmosphere and decor are wonderful, it feels really comfortable and homey in there. Also, the music deserves some kudos, they were playing some bad-ass underground hip hop when we got there which transitioned to the entire Led Zeppelin's Early Days album.\n\nService was fantastic, however, we were one of 2 tables when we arrived, so I would expect fairly undivided attention.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable and ensured that I will certainly consider Local 4 again in the future.  The prices are reasonable given the high quality of the food, and if my only complaint is a lack of beer menu, that's a forgivable sin and a common gripe of mine.

They proceeded to turn on the a/c which couldn't possibly have been working because we were still sweating. \n\nWe ordered the sweet potato fries ($8) and the artichoke dip ($9) as appetizers. First of all, for the price of the appetizers, we were expecting A LOT more than a small plate of fries and a ramekin of dip. The \"crostini\" that came with the dip was inedible...literally. They were burnt and rock hard that they were impossible to bite into. I asked for some pita bread instead which was softer, but had been \"grilled\" which gave it a burnt taste - likely the result of a grill that is not cleaned very often. The sweet potato fries were slightly undercooked and were served with a watery chipotle mayo (great flavour, but thin consistency.)\n\nFor entrees I ordered the falafel which is touted on the menu as being the \"best in the city\" and for $13, I had pretty high expectations. Let me just say that for $5.99 I could've had TWO falafels, double the size, just down the street. and i'm sure they would've been much better tasting. \n\nMy boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich with fries.

I enjoyed my experience, but for the life of me I couldn't figure out if my food was supposed to be a high-end or a low-end meal.\n\nA down-to-earth, friendly server invited us into the restaurant while we were loitering at the door, looking at the menu.  \"C'mon in and give us a try,\" she said, \"We make all our food fresh to order and have something for everyone.\"  It was a hard invitation to resist, although we did note that the restaurant was mostly empty at 7:30 on a Saturday night.  So maybe not for everyone?\n\nShe quickly brought fresh bread, sun-dried italian olives and olive oil and balsamic vinegar for the table.  Nice opening.  We're starting to wonder why more people aren't populating this lovely place.  The menu is pretty standard with pizzas, pastas and mains.  The soup of the day is a cold gazpacho.  I brazenly ignore the fact that it's a spanish dish and order it, along with a pizza.  My husband orders a squash agnolatti with a tomato basil sauce.  I thought that was an odd combo (I'm more of a brown butter and sage person with squash-filled pasta myself), but it sounded good.\n\nThe gazpacho arrives quickly and it is delicious - bright and creamy tasting (maybe some olive oil inside?).  \n\nBut the mains were strangely put together.  My pizza had a perfectly chewy thin crust, but the toppings looked and tasted bland (except for the very good olives).  It oddly had very little flavour and the cheese was cheap tasting and heavy.  It was like Pizza Pizza meets Pizza Libretto.  Weird.\n\nThe pasta dish had the same problem.  The sauce was delicious.  Very rich and flavourful - like you'd expect from a high-end restaurant.  But the pasta itself was overcooked and the filling had the density of the spackle we are using to patch the walls of our new house.  No flavour at all and leaden.

Looked like a nice place, but oddly, completely empty.  That's always a worry, but we went anyway.  Apparently, they won a prize for best burger in Toronto Life, so must be okay.  Noticed that they fry burgers on a griddle instead of char broiling though.  Odd for a real burger place.  Isn't frying a burger a bit like boiling toast?\n\nSo we ordered.  I had the award winning Montreal Burger which featured smoked meat.  We also had a Juicy Lucy which has mozzarella inside it and a portobello mushroom burger.  We ordered some fries which arrived first, like a  starter, which was odd.  They were good, but fries are meant to go with a burger.  That's basic burger stuff to me.  The burgers arrived after we finished the fries completely.\n\nThe portobello burger had two small and limp mushrooms rather than a nice big one, so that was disappointing.  They were pretty greasy too.  My Montreal burger was okay, but as it was fried, not a great flavour to me.  The buns were kind of heavy, so I didn't like them too much either.  The Juicy Lucy was missing the cheese completely, so back it went.  It arrived a bit later and it had the cheese but also a kind of funny smell and taste.  It seemed to us like the meat might be too old.  I didn't like it at all and the others didn't have this taste or smell, so that was worrying.\n\nSo, I guess I know why it was completely empty when we arrived and when we left.

Was mir gleich auffiel, war der Essensgeruch im Lokal. Hat man etwa trotz gelungenem Umbau am Abluftsystem gespart, obwohl im Gastraum hinter einer Glasscheibe gekocht wird? Die Bedienung war sehr freundlich und flink, dafür aber der Rotwein entschieden zu warm. Das Essen war schmackhaft, die Portionen sind überschaubar. Außer der Rechnung von gut 50 € gab es zum Abschied nichts. Auffalend war, dass manche Gäste beim Bezahlen Pflaumenwein serviert bekamen, andere wiederum nicht. Das entscheidet wohl das Los, macht aber keinen guten Eindruck. Die Inneneinrichtung ist modern und ansprechend. Was uns nicht gefiel, war der Kantinencharakter des großen Raumes der zu eng mit Tischen zugestellt war. Etwas mehr Abstand zu den Tischnachbarn und ein paar Abtrennungen bzw. Nischen wären angebracht. Wen das nicht stört, für den ist das Mang sicher eine willkommene Abwechslung.", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "tzEg65PKItc10V4DpLQ-Fw"}

Die Getränke kamen nach der Bestellung schnell an den Tisch.\n\nDas Essen war dann auch einige Minuten (vielleicht 10 min) später am Tisch. Meine Freunde und ich, wir waren sehr erstaunt über das Ambiente und das angenehme Gefühl während des Essens, auch der Geschmack war wirklich außergewöhnlich. Nach dem Essen wurden wir noch auf einen Pflaumenwein eingeladen. Dannach haben wir die Rechnung kommen lassen (4 Personen knapp 50EUR). Selbstverständlich gab es Trinkgeld für das Personal. Anschließend haben wir uns bedankt und wurden freundlich verabschiedet. So sind wir dann angenehm gesättigt nach Hause gegangen. \n\n\nIm Großen und Ganzen ist das MANG sehr empfehlenswert. Zwei Kleinigkeiten könnten vielleicht noch verbessert werden. Einmal Soft-Drinks gibt es nur in 0,3L Gläsern, diese könnten vielleicht größer ausfallen. Ansonsten könnten die Gerichte ein bisschen mehr Schärfe vertragen (das ist meine Meinung), aber ich denke es sind nur einige Kleinigkeiten. ;)\n\nIch hoffe, dass meine Kritik hilfreich war und der eine oder andere sich bei Gelegenheit dazu entschließt auch mal das Restaurant zu testen und hier eine Bewertung zu schreiben.\n\n\n__________________________\n:: Armend S. -- Waiblingen", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "t8Z1MrbAXkgfbuUSaoiVyA"}

There are a couple of tables inside and outside, but we opted for an order to go. A generous plate of curry chicken, rice and peas and plantains was $10, oxtail stew with the same sides was $13.

It's an informal and fun place, I'd come with some friends but it might not be ideal if you are planning an intimate romantic dinner. \n\nThe menu has a lot of good variety. A lot of other places have a lot of very similar sounding pizzas, whereas they was a good mix of tomato-based and white pizzas here with a variety of interesting toppings. I had 'The Donald' - with tallegio, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, sausage. I enjoyed it a lot and I definitely wanted to come back to try some of the other options. Washed it all down with one of my favourite beers, a Beavertown IPA. Pizzas were all around about the £10 mark.\n\nIt's reasonably priced, it's hip, it's fun, and the pizza is great. I will definitely be back.", "type": "review", "useful": 4, "user_id": "eFqg1qaOBHq_Od6fRlMcWA"}

I ordered a Wazeeri Kabob Dinner.\n\nThe food took some time to prepare; maybe ten minutes, wasn't timing it. I imagine they do not do a lot of pre-cooking. I don't mind that at all, but don't expect fast-food service times. As long as the food is good, I think the preparation time was reasonable.\n\nWhat I got was a fair size salad, which tasted fresh and clean, and I enjoyed. The rice was a sort of pilaf with raisins and cooked shredded carrots, which was fine. I'm not keen on cooked raisins in rice, but it's definitely something lots of people enjoy, so I'll withhold my judgement.\n\nThe chicken kabob was the star of the plate. Chicken kabobs are usually cooked to death, dry and unappetizing. This kabob managed to be moist without being undercooked, with slight charring on the corners (pleasantly so). Both kabobs were spiced enough to be interesting without being so spicy that you couldn't really taste the meat. The shami kabob was a nice beef kabob as well, although the chicken kabob really stood out for me.\n\nI also had three pieces of their afghani naan in a little basket. Their naan is clearly popular, I've seen lots of people leaving their attached bakery with armloads of naan bread. I like it well enough, it's hearty, tastes like whole wheat, and well-cooked, but given the choice I'd probably be happier with white puffy indian-style naan. Still, it's good.\n\nIt was a bit too much food for me, and I'm a reasonably big eater. I didn't have any trouble finishing it, but it was more than I needed for lunch. The next time around, I'll probably skip the rice, because it was my least favorite part of the meal anyway.\n\nThe service was solid, although unexceptional.\n\nI went to Afghan Village once in their older location in the same mall, and it didn't really stand out for me. This visit was something else entirely. I can see from the other reviews that some other people had less pleasing experiences than I did, and I haven't been there often enough to know which experience is more common.

Both times I was quite impressed.  Every bite is full of flavor- you can quickly discern that they use the best quality ingredients.  Somehow they are able to get the toppings on the pizza so you get every topping with each bite, however they don't overload it so the pizza is weighted down with toppings.  The crust is thin and pretty good-I like mine crispy and crunchy and theirs could be a bit more crunchy for my taste.  I ordered a sausage and cheese pizza and their version of Hawaiian, both of which are excellent.  The Hawaiian has roasted pineapple, sliced red jalapeño(not too spicy), and their delicious crispy pancetta .  Their sausage is super tasty- they use some excellent quality sausage with fantastic flavor,  they crumble it perfectly so every bite has sausage but not too much.  Great pizza.\nI also ordered a pizza that has marinated cherry tomatoes, artichoke hearts,  and basil.  Scrumptious and delicious.  \nThese guys have a great formula.  Definitely a winner.

The focus is on a \"zen relaxed\" atmosphere, with brick oven pizza and nuances of Asian cuisine (mostly the sides) peppering the menu. \n\nAtmosphere/Ambiance A - It's trendy casual. Interior is Asian themed with splashes of Asian art on the walls and ceiling. (Love the dragon painted beam) The dining area is small 5 tables of two on each side. You can easily rearrange seating for 2 or more. The middle there's a longer high top table for larger parties. There is also seating in the small bar area at back of restaurant. The atmosphere is pretty relaxed, Easy Rock tunes (Brown Eyed Girl) was playing in the background.  No TV's though. Still it's a nice place for lunch or stop by after work and chill in the small bar area kind of joint.\n  \nFood B++ -  Now take into account I'm not a big fan of pizza lately. If you ever notice my pix at pizza places I dine at, I order everything but pizza most of the time...lol. But  for first visit sake I had some here.  All the pizzas are themed with Asian names, but toppings are just your average pizza toppings. I had the Ho-Tai(The Happy Buddha)  which was artichoke hearts, spinach, cherry tomatoes, garlic and olive oil. The crust was baked perfect, NY style, not super thin crust though. The ingredients fresh and good quality. The sauce was evenly distributed on pizza. It didn't overpower the cheese and veggies. I enjoyed the pizza.  It made me happy. \n   \nI also had the chicken salad. Thin strips of tender white chicken and napa cabbage,and rice noodles, the vinaigrette used was perfect for me, just slightly sweet and not too tangy and evenly tossed in the salad. I will most likely come here just to have this salad for lunch next time.  Along with the Japanese pretzel sticks.  Those were different. Tiny pretzel sticks with garlic infused chili oil to dip. \n \nPrices are in the moderate range, I didn't see any lunch hour or happy hour specials.\n  \nService A+ - Friendly and efficient. For being open just a few days, service far out exceeded my expectations.  My server was knowledgeable about menu items and was able to answer my questions. The owner Mark also came by and followed up and chatted with me. He takes great pride and rightfully so with his new place.  Loves everything about Hawaii and the shave ice served here is inspired by Matsumoto's.  It's not quite like shave ice from the 808, but nice attempt with the Azuki (sweet red beans) and vanilla ice cream.\n\nThe other fun touches....The Wish Book! When you are presented with your check at the end, you get a Smartie candy and a little booklet where you get to write your wish and insert it in the wish keeper that's displayed in the middle of dining area. My wish didn't really come true this time around, a 49er win..ha! I had a nice dining experience though, that's what counts.", "type": "review", "useful": 10, "user_id": "2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg"}

It's a new pizza joint that opened last month in Henderson and I love it!  It's not a very big place, but it packs a lot of punch, just like Pacquiao (except he got knocked out decisively after dinner, but I digress).  Before the Big Fight, my friend and I had dinner at PB and thoroughly enjoyed our first visit.  I say first because we'll definitely be back.  The name of the restaurant may lead one to believe that they serve some kind of weird Asian pizza combinations, but it's not like that, my friends.  There exists a Buddhist theme to the place, from the Asian decor to the names of the menu items, but the specialty pizzas are creative, not Asian, per se.  My date and I chose to create our own and settled on a large mushroom, pancetta, and shaved garlic pizza.  We ordered the PB Egg Rolls appetizer to start, which were 3 large egg rolls filled with ricotta and spinach.  Served steaming hot with a side of marinara sauce, they were tasty and I told our waiter he should have brought us 4 so we didn't have to split the 3rd one.  Our pizza arrived not too long after and we both agreed it was Buddha-licious, not greasy at all with a good-karma inducing crust and soul-soothing sauce.  I had two slices because I wanted to leave room for the dessert, shaved ice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, azuki beans, and your choice of root beer, orange, or cherry flavor.  We chose the root beer and this would be my only gripe about the evening:  there was not enough root beer for all the shaved ice, as more than half of it was just ice with none of the root beer.  Don't order the dessert expecting Snow Ono-quality.  Our bill was served with Smarties candy and a Wish book for each of us to write down a wish and place it in the Wish Maker near the entrance.  Our waiter was fantastic, helpful in terms of the menu and attentive throughout the entire meal, genuinely positive and friendly.  My wish for you is that you get yourself to Pizza Buddha and enjoy the experience as we did.  Peace out.", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA"}

I've been to this burger joint a few times and not going to lie, it's a solid choice.  They started off strong amongst the slowly crowding burger scene in Toronto and kinda died off. I'm not sure if it's simply the sheer number of new places always popping up or if quality has gone down since the doors first opened.\n\nFrom the few times I've been, they have been pretty consistent.  I mean their burgers have never been the best as they would have liked to proclaim or the early reviewers would have suggested.  On this occasion I dropped by Oh Boy with Angela for lunch. I ended up ordering the cheese burger combo for just 9.95. I upgraded and got the sweet potato fries and onion rings with an iced tea. I topped it with the traditional toppings with ketchup and mayo. Angela got a Hawaiian burger with an iced tea.  She also opted for the traditional toppings with ketchup.\n\nNow the burger is a solid burger. It's meaty and has a decent flavour to it. I like how it's not overly done so the moisture is still there. The amount of fries and onion rings were huge. I mean I love the portion sizes at oh boy. I come here knowing I'll be hitting a food coma when I'm done.  The sides weren't as strong as it has been in the past.  The crispiness wasn't there for the sweet potato fries and the onion rings were a little worse than their usual.  So definitely a little disappointing and I can see why there's a drop from their initial launch.  Angela liked her burger and like me, felt it was a solid all around burger.  I guess for the both of us it was disappointing to see oh boy go. The place was pretty much a pub which specialized in serving burgers.  They had the bar at the back with flat screens but I guess it just didn't work out in the end.\n\nOverall, I liked oh boy. It's nothing out of the extraordinary, but sometimes all you want is a familiar taste at pretty reasonable prices. I'm a huge believer of leaving a restaurant full. Love that satisfying feeling and knowing that I got a good bang for my buck.  With it closing, I can only hope for another burger joint to take its place.  A place that will also provide a similar feel and bang for my buck.

They weren't young, but they were extremely 'young' acting, and immature. \nWe kinda knew what we were in for, but decided to continue in .. \n \nThe 'girl behind the cash' was a mid-aged-overly-made-up blonde girl, who looked lovely, but didn't have much rattling around in her head. \nWe placed our orderr: a little oh boy combo (there version of 2 sliders & 1 side (fries) & drink) and a Hog Town Combo (w/fries) and a single order of Onion Rings. \n\n\nSo, as we're waiting, we watch these 2 guys (I'll call them Griller #1 & Griller #2) huddled behind a very very small work space & exposed grill, that's publically displayed, so we can watch the exciting grilling action - kinda cool, right? \nNo, not really. \nBecause of the heat, it was just a fogged up mess. \nBut after witnessing what little we did, I highly doubt they'll want to advertise what goes on behind there! \n\nMy boyfriend then notices the box of burgers, on the floor. Just sittin' there. \nWe then watch, a guy come to pick up his order, and confirm his request of 'NO MAYONNAISE'. Griller #1 behind the counter, then looks at the burger in his hand, that he had just squired a load of mayo on. Noticing his mistake (and the guy who had requested it), he throws the burger to one side, and accepts a 'fresh' burger from Griller #2. And he re-makes his burger. This time with no mayo.\nGriller #2 must see potential for resale (!), so he starts scraping the mayo off .. and throws it back on the grill!!!\nAHHHHH!!\nGriller # 1 & Griller #2 were definite loud mouths - they were swearing, and making fun of how bad their service was - they were joking about drug use *including being under the influence* .. just the weirdest crap I'd ever heard spewing out ... and completely unprofessional. \n\n\nWe also witnessed them re-frying food.\nfries specifically.  \n \n\nOur food was 'ready' - \nSo. We never got the single order of onion rings. We didn't notice this until we got home, and inspected our dinner. \nThat, after we had watched the one Griller get in 'trouble' from the other Griller, for serving 'too many onion rings' in an order. \nMakes one wonder ...\n\nSo, for $32.21 - failed & incomplete order\n .75 cents - 20 minutes of parking, \nOh Boy! Did we get ripped off.\n\n\nThis all happened while we were there.\nI'm actually not even done my meal, but wanted to write this review while it was so fresh in my mind.\nAND//\nThey Had NO DIET POP.  \nburger was dry.dry.dry.\nugh.", "type": "review", "useful": 6, "user_id": "JjicSN4Fyyi40DH7hGzc-A"}

I ordered the Oh Boy Classic with 3 Cheese combo, with a half-and-half fries and onion rings (it's not on the menu, although I think it should be, so don't count on this).  They have Mill Street Tankhouse on tap, and I indulged.  \n\nThe burger came OEM with lettuce, tomato, guacamole, and a good slice each of cheddar, swiss and havarti.  Aftermarket options exist, but the stock version sounded good enough already.\n\nAnd it was.\n\n8 ounces of AAA ground chuck, grilled to perfection and juicier than a Georgia peach in full season.  The guacamole had a creamy texture and flavour that added a high note to the gooey cheesy goodness, yet somehow through all that rich flavour the patty still managed to shine through and remind me why I was there in the first place.  I was in heaven for the three minutes that burger lasted in my hands.\n\nThe onion rings were fantastic - just a really well-made, classic ring.

Joey claims that he's \"old, like really old\", but doesn't look a day over 30.\n3.  The Oh Boy! name stems from a diner in Toronto that no longer exists and is going to be a brand that says they're serious about what they do but still have fun doing it.\n4.  It took a year to get Oh Boy! up and running due to the building almost falling over and new structural elements needing to be implemented.\n5.  Joey picked the Queen Street location to be close to the entertainment district without needing to be in the middle of all the hype of the ED.\n6.  Oh Boy! was started to give people a better experience to enjoy a burger.  Joey describes the experience as coming to the restaurant and enjoying premium quality ingredients while hanging out with friends, and grabbing a beer while the game plays in the background.\n\nUpon this return to Oh Boy! I was even more impressed just due to the fact that they have Okanagan Springs on tap.  It was also great to see that they're working through the growing pains and things are coming together for them.\n\nIt was nice to see that our server Vharay was genuine in her involment to make sure we had a good experience and had everything we needed.", "type": "review", "useful": 8, "user_id": "YRcaNlwQ6XXPFDXWtuMGdA"}

I got the Portobello burger, which is hopefully the healthiest 'burger' on the menu.  The topping options are all very similar to Hero Burger.  But, the sauces at Oh Boy are all free, including Guacamole!  I thought I had loaded it up with a variety of sauces and toppings, but when it came out it looked kind of puny due to Shrinkage of the 'bello.  The Chipotle BBQ sauce is not very spicy, but is very tasty. The Lettuce is no cheap ice-berg from a bag, it's good quality boston lettuce. \nThey have a few kinks to work out, but now is the time to go, because this place is going to get packed. On this First Sunday afternoon, there was hardly any room to sit. The front area is full of booths as is the back. In the middle there are a row of stools to sit on. \nThe back bar area is surrounded by TV's showing football and I can see this being a huge thing- bar, bar stools, booths and burgers.  \nI also tasted the poutine. The fries are on the small side, which is nice. But the gravy is very beefy and reminds me of the City Hall truck's gravy. This could be a good thing, but it's pretty low on my list of faves in the city.  The food is decent, the atmosphere is wicked and late night line ups are certain.

I had high hopes for finally hitting the mother lode for burgers. (sigh) The previous reviews just went all over the place and I wasn't so sure what to expect but when my brother burger reviewer Chris P. sang the praises of the beef on a bun at Oh Boy I thought that they would be all that and a bag of chips. \n\nI had appointments on Camden Street this morning so on my way out I thought I'd grab a burger from Oh Boy and take it for a dance. Trouble was that this burger couldn't even two step and basically had two left feet. I arrived at Oh Boy literally on the nose of noon hoping to beat the lunch rush and ordered up an Oh Little Boy Combo with sweet potato fries. Most of the major complaints I've read about OB's is that they seem to overcook the burgers so I figured if I ordered up the baby burgers and being smaller, they'd spend less time on the grill. Makes sense, right? Ummmmm....apparently not. It took almost 25 minutes before my order finally surfaced. \n\nSo out the door I dash with my lunch bag in hand only to discover ten minutes later that they eff'ed up my order. Wrong kind of cheese on those little sliders. No sweet potato fries but rather regular french fries which were soggy and cold by the time I got to them. As for those little 2 ounce burgers.... well they were pretty much small pieces of carbon on a bun. Did I order blackened burgers? They were dry and crusty and no amount of toppings was going to save these little charred nuggets. \n\nSomeone needs to smack those grill boys with a hot spatula because when you eff up Momma's burger she is gonna be pissed big time. For this shitty bag of baby burgers I forked out $13 bucks. I felt like I'd been hosed. \n\nThe restaurant itself is really cool. It's large and unlike Craft that can seat only about 8 people, the Oh Boy seats about 100 people. I love the bar area and I'm hopeful that eating in the restaurant would yield a much more favorable result. I've still got my discount coupons from the very first time I wandered in and the grill was out of commission. If anyone is interested in using them, let me know, I'm not so sure I'm ready to go back to Oh Boy just yet. \n\nAfterwards I thought to myself that I should have walked a little further east and gone in to the Leslieville Cheese Store and gotten a grilled cheese for lunch.

Second, the meat lacked any distinctive beefy flavour and was very bland - it was almost like eating frozen patty.

Their bruschetta is piled high on each piece of bread they give you. You can really taste the fresh ingredients, but for some reason it all seems to fail to come together in the end. There is something missing. This ended up being a theme of our meals there. My girlfriend had a pizza with pesto and grilled chicken pieces. The chicken could have been spread out a little more throughout the pizza, but this could be the way they do it in Italy so I can't judge. This dish also seem to struggle to bring everything together.bThe dish I had was a creamy pasta with goat cheese and walnuts. I actually really enjoyed this dish but somehow think it needed just a little more kick.\n\nBeing on the tourist trap of a street that is crescent, I wasn't expecting cheap prices.

The resto has an upper floor for bigger parties. The view gives on to Crescent and de Maisoneuve. The portions were reasonable. The price was too. I had the chicken al palio which was decent. I suggest ordering pasta, because theres a large selection and it comes with a decent amount of protein or vegetables. The crowd seems reletively young (early and late 20s), especially when I was there. The drinks are averagely sized, I didnt check the price though. \n\nWhat I didn't like: My friend who was the birthday girl had made a reservation for the correct amount of people, but when she arrived places were missing. We were stuck reorganizing the seating our selves. I feel they really work hard to give a true italian feel by allowing a 45 minute delay between serving everyone else and then serving me. The music wasn't appropriate at all, a mix of rap with some asian sounding stuff. Given that it was the coldest day of the year, most of us froze upstairs waiting to get our plates and then waiting to pay. \n\nConclusion: not my favorite resto. I wouldnt call it \"authentic\" food, although the disorganized managament seems authentically italian. You'll probably not see me back here. The only thing that could bring me back is the location.

I'm not expecting a lot when it's a situation like this, but this restaurant was not able to live up to my already lowered expectation. \n\nFood:\nThe server brought us two baskets of complimentary bread with a dish of olive oil and vinegar . The bread looks decent, they look like some homemade croissants. But, the texture was awful!  None of us can take a second bite of it, it's so dry! It taste like it's either a few days old or it has been microwaved multiple times! Also, the olive oil to share? what is this? Are they expecting everyone to dip in that plate? It's so gross....and inconvenient. Its okay to share butter or other spread, but I've never shared olive oil before.\nWe ordered an Italian sausage pizza as appetizers to share, it was average, the crust was too thick...nothing special.\nMain course, I ordered a veggie primervera, which is just vegetarian pasta with tomato sauce.  It did not satisfy me either, overall very blend and in terms of vegetables, I was expecting some portebello mushroom, big slice of eggplants and cucumber, cherry tomato.... but instead, it's all thinly sliced, you almost can't see them in your pasta, and just regular mushroom that were shrunk after cooking. The tomato sauce was also too glue-y.....\nDessert - I shared a Tiramisu with a friend, it's the type that comes in a cup with lady fingers at the bottom of the cup. This was like one of the worst tiramisu you can get at a restaurant. It tastes like store bought, and made one week ago. The cheese on the top are already becoming chewy and jello like! We only had half\n\nThe food are so terrible, when the server came and ask how were the  food, I actually said it tastes bad (because he saw our unfinished tiramisu) and I think he was offended.\n\nService:\nHe forgot to bring the spoon for people who ordered pasta. SO this is what happened, I asked for a spoon as soon as he puts down my plate of pasta, and it took him like 5mins to come back because he went off and took care of other tables and he forgot... when he came back, he only brought 1 spoon for me, not for my other friends who were also having pasta. (well, you'd expect him to bring enough for everyone who's having pasta, that's a standard utensils to eat pasta , especially it's an Italian restaurant, how do you not know that) ...Later, my friends that are sitting at the other end of the table had to ask him again for spoon... \n\nAmbiance:\nnice patio of second floor....maybe you can come here for drinks, but just don't eat here", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "ys-6BWxpS1BpUkHZA9oLqQ"}

My ladies and I rolled in sometime past midnight on a Saturday, i.e. normal bar time, excited to make it rain. We came from Parts & Labour next door, where the service was terrible but at least they had Summerlicious to use as a poor excuse. Can't say the same for Geraldine, where we were greeted by a permanent air of I-hate-our-customers.\n\nAs our server brought the first drink (and first bill) to our table, she informed us that it was \"cash and carry\" because it was \"late\". We were like, \"Huh?\" It wasn't even busy and the bar wasn't closing. She said we'd have to pay for each drink as we went. I've never been to a sit-down place with $18+tax drinks that had a bill accompany every glass, but it's certainly a good way to leave a sour taste in people's mouths before they've even tasted the Sazerac.\n\nWe'd barely taken our first sips when the server came back, pointedly* tapped on the cheque she'd just brought my friend and said something like, \"Your bill's right here.\" Yeah, we know! You told us five seconds ago. Holy tacky.\n\nBefore we left, another friend with more cojones than yours truly spoke to our server to politely question the automatic 20% gratuity** based on the level (read: low) of service she received. Even after some back and forth, in an amazing demonstration of the very lack of customer service skills being called out, the server refused to reissue the bill. Seriously? Is the auto-tip on groups here a free pass to be awful? Another girl accidentally double-tipped because of this, too.\n\nI'm not sure what the folks at Geraldine found to dislike about making quick money on a chilled-out group downing pricy drinks for maybe an hour. The styling is fancy but the vibe was so not. Maybe it was just this one server, but I won't be back to find out. Cheers!\n\n*Speaking of \"pointedly\", the bartender scooped up a loose flower petal on the side of my glass with his finger and plopped it right back in, giving my cocktail what NSYNC would refer to as a \"digital digital getdown\". I'm no flower myself, so I didn't mind, but a germaphobe might shudder.\n**Quick PSA on auto-tips courtesy of The Grid - you don't actually have to suck it up if the service is shitty: http://www.thegridto.com/blog-post/what-the-food-whats-the-deal-with-automatic-gratuities-for-groups/", "type": "review", "useful": 11, "user_id": "5L6jkxWlbBO3YWP6kQ2VrQ"}

Food service took some time and while we initially ordered oysters it took easily 30 minutes to get them out. We had a variety of sides but had to ask for more and at $6 for a plate of olives it's a bit pricey. The Cauliflower was pretty good but very salty, the shrimp and grits were excellent. In terms of mains I had the quail which was served on a piece of toast with a corn type salad, it was not hearty at all and very boney, a little pricey for the amount of food served up. My wife had a steak as did a few others at the table, no one was really raving about it, I tried it and felt it was very buttery. The others had the seafood broth or whatever fancy french word they used, I tried it and it was very good, that was the winner at the table. Dessert unfortunately there was only one choice and no one went for it, i thought that was a bit sad to not offer more towards the end. Overall our bill came to just under 600 with tip, I feel that when there is a big party a restaurant should not bring down their service, nobody came to ask us how are food was, no one asked us if they can get us anything else, our wine glasses were touched up on once and there was no explanation of any food that was coming out of the kitchen except for the oysters. I thought that area was lacking. Nice atmosphere and we are lucky we had good company, but overall this place is average as many places in Toronto and will have to get a little better in certain areas.

So it seemed like the perfect time to go. \n\nAs soon as we walked in, we fell into a time-warp and instantly we were transported to the 1920s during prohibition. The vibe was cool and calm, the staff was warm and friendly. \n\nFirst, the drinks.... Marie had warned me about the prices of the drinks and I couldn't understand why they charged so much for cocktails.  Needless to say, I ate my words in the form of a beverage.  Easily the best cocktails in the city, no contest. \n\nMichael is a wizard behind the bar, constructing his elixirs right in the open for on-lookers to see.  I was thrilled to see REAL Absinthe on the cocktail menu, but I was even more excited when I saw how he prepared it and presented it.  I am not going to spoil it for you, you just have to see for yourself... Amazing. \n\nOur server Brendan offered up some oysters from East Coast to West Coast.  This guy knew his shit and you could tell he took pride in his work.  He took care of us for the evening, we never felt rushed and it was completely relaxing.... or perhaps that was the Absinthe talking?\n\nFor me, Chef Molitz' challenge was going to be finding his stride within the French realm of cooking and technique.  This is a stark contrast to the rustic Modern-Canadian style that we are all use to from Alex.  So this dinner was going to be interesting, at least from the point of view of a French food geek like myself. \n\nThere is a reason why Alex is revered as one of Toronto's best; his ability to serve up consistent, rich flavours that are on point and familiar to the senses.  The Duck Croquette reminded me of childhood dinners of mash potatoes and turkey at Thanksgiving.  And the Duck Confit was crispy and salty just as it should be, served with bean cassoulet that was smokey and creamy.   Delicious. \n\nIf I had to order one thing on the menu, (aside from the Absinthe of course) it would be the Vietnamese Coffee and Chocolate Chip cookies.  It simply hits all the right areas.\n\nGeraldine is a classic.", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "HS7WW9oFGTdJfC90kCHpkg"}

NEVER in my life did I think it would take me over 30 minutes to first place my order with one of the most incompetent cashiers I have ever seen in my 16 years of being in the service industry myself. I had to say 3 times to her alone what type of coffee I wanted, along with another 3 times to tell her I wanted it with ice. She then handed me the smallest hot coffee I have ever seen. She then, with an attitude the ENTIRE time, got a manager to come and help her. She then made me a coffee after I had to tell her twice as well what I wanted. She hands me two of the smallest ice coffees I have ever seen. I asked the cashier with an attitude if it was actually a medium because I am in shock as to how small it is. She grabs it out of my hand and holds the cup up while pointing to a small M on the side of it. I tasted both of the shit coffees they gave me. One tasted like chocolate milk and the other one tasted like straight espresso. What I ordered was two iced French Vanilla lattes, add mocha and add an extra turbo shot. I literally order this from a couple different McDonald's and know it's something they make. So. I then ask the bitch cashier to see a manager because at this point I'm just furious. She informs me the lady that made my coffees was my manager but her gm was also there. So I asked to speak to him. She stands there just yelling his name. I literally laughed to myself. The gm comes out from the back. He happens to be the man who I heard at the counter a few minutes before then telling the staff and pretty much anybody in there how he had to deal with another store being robbed of 487 dollars. Like. I'm an assistant gm. I have been a gm. You do NOT come in and act like that as a gm. I ask him if he can remake my coffee because they are not correct and taste like shit. I tell him what I want and he basically was telling me in a nut shell what I order at least 3 times a week, isn't possible. He luckily made me the coffees I asked for. And again with more attitude hands me my tiny ass little coffee. Then as I try to say thank you, he just pretends I'm not standing there and keeps commanding his lazy incompetent staff on where trash cans should be. Like come the fuck on Robert M. I think you paying attention to customer service, food times and what you're actual job entails rather than standing there bitching like a high school child. Literally no sooner did I turn around, another lady had come inside complaining about how she had been waiting 20 minutes for a caramel frappe. Somebody higher up needs to handle this store and teach their employees to have manners as well as know what they are supposed to be doing. It's common sense on how you treat people in restaurants, fast food or not. I will literally NEVER step foot into that place again and by the end of the day will be calling district managers and whoever else I can. I would recommend waiting at Dunkin Doughnuts where it would at least have been well worth the wait.

When I told my friends where I was going for dinner, I was met with furrowed brows of confusion.  \"Dane? Like the Great Dane?\"  Admittedly, I was not familiar with the city or its citizens either, but I had heard great things about this little bar called Tootsie's and their inventive, and at times risky cuisine.  I found out quickly that  this little hometown gem was worth the back-country trek. \n\n From the outside, this place looks like your standard dive bar, and honestly, it's appearance on the inside does too.  There are several tables set up for dining and a singular pool table lurking in the corner.  All of these things are fairly standard,  but what makes Tootsie's special is the proprietor, employees, and patrons.  We were there on a weekday night and the place was just banging.  Each person sitting at the bar was friendly and inviting.  Drinks were flowing and the party was on.  The owner was walking around and talking to everyone and the bartender and chef were equally amiable.  \n\nWhat was even more impressive was the food.  Tootsie's surprisingly houses a full kitchen in the back of the bar, making it possible to provide high end daily specials to patrons. The night we were there the special was  roasted quail and smoked pork belly.  We had the choice of picking either of the options or a combination of both. My dining partner and I opted for one of each.  Usually I'm very critical of the way restaurants cook each of these proteins.  Pork belly is one of those foods, along with duck breast, that is ruined for me without proper rendering.  At Tootsie's it was cooked perfectly, and was served in a large meaty portion. Yum.  The quail was cooked to perfection, boasting moist morsels of meat.  \n\nWait....hold on...I forgot one major thing: the ranch.  \n\nSome people (my husband included) look down on me for my love of ranch dressing, but I stand proud with my obsession.  I will eat anything dipped in this herbed mayonnaise sauce.  The chef at Tootsie's brought me out TWO different kinds of ranch to use on my salad and side dishes, and I was in heaven.  For me, the ranch alone is worth the trip. \n\nOverall, go to Tootsie's with your expectations in check.  This small bar will most likely win you over the same way it wooed me.  It was a fun trip out to the country for this city girl, and I plan on making it many many more times.", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "zGZQVnnYe8K7A8JMzmNpHQ"}

Malgré mes explications, on m'a remis 7 dollars, soit bien moins que la surcharge, quand on tient compte des taxes et du pourboire.\n\nBref,chez Da Enrico, on n'hésite pas à vous frauder en plein visage, avec le sourire.

Tja, was soll ich sagen - auf Stuttgarts architektonischer Gruselmeile namens Heilbronner Straße fiel mir irgendwann das Altbauensemble positiv auf, und das Design des Eingangs wirkte ansprechend. Und es waren auch nirgends verwertbare Kritiken zu finden... Und so fanden wir uns heute im Weissenhof wieder, nachdem der Tafelberg keinen Platz für uns hatte.\n \nBei der telefonischen Reservierung bat ich um einen schönen Tisch und wurde gleich gefragt, ob es ein besonderer Anlaß sei - meine Antwort war nein, wir hätten nur gerne was am Fenster oder am Rand und nicht direkt im Getümmel. Wurde vermerkt und auch erfüllt, wäre angesichts der sehr übersichtlichen Besetzung an einem Freitagabend nicht wirklich nötig gewesen.\n \nDer Eingang zum Restaurant ist identisch mit Hotel und Bar, man steigt außen die Stufen hoch und wird hinter den Türen gleich von einem riesigen Kronleuchter begrüßt, der - zumindest heute abend - pink angestrahlt war. Hinter dem Kronleuchter ging eine Innentreppe gleich weiter in den Hotelbereich, rechts und links von dieser landete man an der Bar mit ledergepolsterten Bänken und dunkelbraunen Tischen zu beiden Seiten, rechts biegt man ins Restaurant ab. Die Farbstellung ist creme-braun, laut Karte zitiert man - Überraschung - die Weissenhofsiedlung, deshalb auch der eher gewöhnungsbedürftige braun-beige gemusterte Teppich im Restaurant, das farblich ebenfalls in cremefarbenen Leder und dunklem Holz gehalten war. Ja, und da geht's schon los, warum haben Hotelrestaurants immer Teppichboden? Und gruselige abgehängte Decken? Und eine Beleuchtung, wie sie kein normales Restaurant installieren würde? Fragen über Fragen, unfair, weil ja, wir sind im Hotel.\n \nDer bei weitem angenehmste Teil des Hotel-Seins war der Service. Der war umwerfend, freundlich, souverän, unaufdringlich, eine gelungene Interaktion mit dem Gast, weder servil noch desinteressiert. Könnte ich dafür sechs Sterne geben, jederzeit sofort. Also ganz, ganz großes Kompliment! Und wirklich schöne Überraschung war die Aperitiv-Empfehlung Trollinger brut, ein außerordentlicher Schaumwein, der mit meinem Trollinger-Alptraum von der IHK absolut nichts gemeinsam hat. Mit € 5,90 für 0,1 l aber auch sehr anspruchsvoll in der Preislage. Brot kam zügig, nicht schlecht, aber es fehlte an Knusprigkeit. Die Butter dazu war eiskalt, keine ideale Kombination. Verwunderlicherweise kein Gruß aus der Küche, hätte ich bei einem Restaurant mit diesem Anspruch eigentlich erwartet.\n \nDie Karte ist eher klein, man wirbt mit Schwäbisch / Österreichisch (österreichisch das Menü, die Fleischgerichte und ein paar Nachspeisen), zwischendurch einige Einsprengsel nicht ganz eindeutiger Provenienz zwischen Crossover und Büffelmozzarella. Eine Handvoll Vorspeisen (Carpaccio von der Maultasche, Beef Tartar), zwei Suppen, dreimal Fisch (gedämpfter Viktoriabarsch, Zander mit Paprikapolenta), zweimal Vegetarisch (Erdäpfel-Schwammerl-Gulasch, Topfen/Kraut), vier oder fünf Fleischgerichte (Tafelspitz, Kalbsrahmgulasch), ebensoviele Desserts.\nWirklich sehr gute Weinauswahl mit Schwerpunkt Ba-Wü und Ö, ungewöhnlich, exzellent und - pardon - schweineteuer. 1/8 Weiß vom exklusiveren Teil der Karte war bei € 6,20 bis 7,90, zugegeben, die Weine waren außergewöhnlich mit Empfehlung auf den Weingütern Currle und Hager (die günstigeren fingen bei  € 2,90 das Achtel an, aber wir waren probierwütig), aber bei € 6,60 für 0,75 l Vösslauer Mineralwasser medium würde ich mich sehr gerne mal mit dem Controller unterhalten.\n \nMein Mann nahm das österreichische Menü mit schwäbischem Einschlag, erst Flädlesuppe (nein, nicht Frittatensuppe, Frittaten seien knuspriger als Flädle, hieß es), dann Wiener Schnitzel mit Kartoffelsalat, etwas Feldsalat und Preißelbeeren, zum Schluß Kaiserschmarrn mit Zwetschgenkompott und Apfelmus. Ich war konzeptlos und nahm den Papayasalat mit Thunfisch (drei Würfel Thunfisch, einmal mit Petersilie, einmal kroß natur, einmal mit Leinsamen, alle drei innen noch roh, tolle Qualität), das Dressing sehr neutral bis geschmacksarm, einzig belebt von ein paar Blättchen Thai-Basilikum. Die gute Produktqualität ließ die fehlende Originalität verzeihen. Flädlesuppe war eher auf der salzigen Seite und laut meiner besseren Hälfte nichts besonderes.\n \nDanach die organisatorische Herausforderung, ich hatte die Kukuruzsuppe und anschließend den ganzen Saibling mit Petersilienkartoffeln bestellt, mein Mann eben Hauptgang und Dessert, die salomonische Lösung war, mir die Suppe separat zu bringen, fand ich auch besser als wenn der Saiblingduft zum Kaiserschmarrn rüberzieht. Und die Suppe war das absolute Highlight des Abends, e...", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "WjVUkCnH3KA37BjPJ0e0Yw"}

Viel Sahne und Würzmittel eben. \nAnschließend hatte ich Teigtaschen mit Steinpilzfüllung (15 Euro), für die dasselbe gilt: Ich habe absolut keinen Pilz, schon gar keinen Steinpilz herausschmecken können. Da sie schmeckten wie in einer schlechten Kantine, fragte ich die Bedienung, ob diese Pasta im eigenen Haus angefertigt worden sei. Sie sagte ganz schnell \"Ja\" und verschwand sofort wieder. Wobei ich sagen muss, dass die Bedienung mit ihrer Freundlichkeit und ihrer Aufmerksamkeit der einzige Glanzpunkt in diesem Restaurant war. Meine Begleitung hatte einen schwäbischen Rostbraten (19 Euro). das Fleisch war gut. Die Spätzle waren sehr dick und schwammen in einer total überfetteten Soße. \nDanach gab es als Dessert noch ein Bananensorbet.

Das Restaurant empfängt in einem modernen, modischen aber dennoch attraktiven, wenn auch etwas kühlem Ambiente. Die Begrüßung war freundlich, professionell und effizient. Das Restaurant empfiehlt sich selbst als Restaurant einer österreichisch-schwäbischen Küche und so fiel die Wahl für den Test auf das Wiener Schnitzel, das auf der Speisekarte als \"Wiener Schnitzel vom Stauffenberg-Kalb mit Erdäpferl-Vogerlsalat\" präsentiert wird und nach eigener Wahl durch ein Glas Grünen Veltliner Federspiel begleitet werden sollte. Nun, ein Glas des Weines reichte zur Begleitung nicht, da zwischen Bestellung und Servieren des Schnitzels rund 90 Minuten vergingen. Die viel zu lange Wartezeit wurde durch zwei kleine Scheibchen Weißbrot überbrückt, was sehr schwer fiel. Das Schnitzel selbst war eher ein Schnitzelchen und entsprach nicht ganz den Erwartungen an ein wirklich gutes Wiener Schnitzel. Und auch der Erdäpferl-Vogerlsalat war ok, aber nicht wirklich sehr gut, alles zum Preis von rund 22 Euro. Das von der Begrüßung bekannte Servicepersonal war mittlerweile auch schon verschwunden und man hatte auch nach dem Servieren den Eindruck, \"vergessen\" worden zu sein. \n\nFazit: Wenn man im Hotel übernachtet und den Fußweg in die Innenstadt scheut, kann man bei nicht zu hoch gesteckten Erwartungen, das Restaurant besuchen.

I went to Sam's Cafe last night with two of my girlfriends and based on my previous experience at the downtown location, I figured we'd get a pretty decent meal.  Not the case!\n\nCarter, our server, was awful.  I hate to be so hard on him but as soon as he took our drink order and we didn't order any alcoholic beverages, he went downhill from there.  My friend Allyson ordered the rotisserie chicken special and I ordered the applewood smoked pecan salmon.  DeDe had a few question before she decided and Carter not only had no clear answers for her, he didn't bother to try to get the answers.  Unacceptable!  (Just to clarify, these were basic questions such as 'what kind of vegetables come on the fire grilled vegetable tacos?' and 'What is the marinade for the chicken fajitas?')  \n\nThe next thing we know, we are given their special chips and salsa... I love how they combine sweet and salty in a colorful arrangement!  Those were delicious.  However, it was a good ten minutes until we saw our water and when you are eating salty chips and salsa, it's nice to have something to wash it down with!  Minus star #2.\n\nSo, our food comes and DeDe's fajitas are totally different than what Carter explained.  She isn't bitchy about sending them back but kindly asks for just the chicken and vegetables on a plate since that is what she was expecting.  This is where the 3rd missing star comes in - I am not kidding when I tell you that DeDe did not get her food until after both Allyson and I were done eating ours (and we were eating really slow)!  It was not right... and Carter was not very apologetic.  He came over to offer us a free dessert but being that we are all in healthy eating mode, we declined.  They did take the fajitas off the bill in the end, but it was expected at this point.\n\nSo, I know it was just one bad experience, but if I feel like Sam's Cafe again, I will probably head to the downtown location or just have lower expectations in the future.\n\nBottom line:  decent meal + bad service = 2 stars!", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "dIIKEfOgo0KqUfGQvGikPg"}

(you know, I think I sweat so much because I come from ice age survivor stock and here I am trying to live in the desert!).\nAnyway, after we finished our extremely grueling, yet fulfilling programs of physical exercise, got ourselves all cleaned up, (lookin' good and smellin' sweet) we were talking between ourselves (as married people often do) and trying to figure how to reward ourselves for the excellent workouts we had just finished.\nHow about a nice big lunch?\nSam's Café has Happy Hours on Saturday's and Sunday's that run from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm. \nWell, that's just inspired!\nWe tottered in and sat at the bar (I think that's going to be a defining happy hour \"move\" for us), and the barman greeted us with a warmth and enthusiasm normally reserved for long lost play cousins...a good start:)\nWe looked at the happy hour menu and they have some nice selections for really good prices.\nWe ordered roast pork sliders with a chipotle barbecue sauce, Carin's  \"go-to\" selection...grilled chicken nacho's and Sedona Spring Rolls (also served with the chipotle barbecue sauce and pico de gallo).\nWhile were waiting for the food to arrive, Sam's minions brought us more food...chips and salsa. \nNow, I don't want anyone to think Sam's is mexcian food...it's not. The whole place is more \"southwest inspired\" as opposed to \"southwest\", or \"Mexican\" or \"authentic\". \nThey have décor that looks sort of Fredrick Remington meets Javier Sordo Madaleno...nice, southwest-ish/modern. The chairs in the dining room are, frankly, less than comfortable but they fit the décor, so, OK. Just don't complain to me when they make your butt sore after 20 minutes!\nBack to the chips and salsa...I like the flour tortilla chips that Sam's serves, as well as the blue corn and sweet potato chips and the salsa is decent as well...very tomatoey, but spicy and flavorful, but it's not Mexican...not for everybody, but we were happy:)\nThe actual food portion of our lunch came before we became completely engorged with the chips portion. Everything was very tasty. \nThe pork roast sliders were truly delightful...moist, seasoned perfectly on soft warm rolls:) (BTW, I'm reasonably certain that you can't get swine flu from eating pork roast, but I will say that the roast pork sliders \"flew\" off the plate:) . The Sedona Spring Rolls have plenty of spice and heat, and are also very nice.\nAll in all, a very solid Happy Hour offering for $18 and change (before tip).\nGo, sit at the bar (always better service and your butt will thank me), and enjoy Sam's Happy Hour!", "type": "review", "useful": 10, "user_id": "SrF972IxsELYQ3eaWB5X4A"}

There's a table spoon of hollandaise sauce and the plate is really sad looking. Finally after more than an hour of service we finally get our first glass of water and toast. If you compared it with eggspectation, im telling you, eggspectation is just Wayyy better and you won't feel rip off.\n\nAt this point I don't even want to complain. We had 2 different server and now the manager is serving us. Its really strange because overall we had 4 different server (3 server and 1 manager) doing the service.\nThe manager took a while before finally taking out finished plates. He made and inappropriate comment to my friend about her not finishing her potatoes that made everybody uncomfortable. \n\nMy friend told me then that when she arrive 15 min early for brunch the manager told her really seriously to wait outside. when she was about to turn around and leave he told her that it was a joke... so you can have a good picture of the brilliant type of manager running that place. \n\nFinally for our last dish, my friend who is a pastry chef got pastries of course.

They never asked us if we wanted water, and the drink I had ordered was not available so we both ordered cold drinks - he had Ginger Lemonaide and I had Orangeaide.  Loved the Ginger flavor, but both the drinks were syrup sweet - which was not what we were hoping for - we like our citrus to have some tang.\nThen we ordered a bowl of soup, quesdilla with brie and onion marmalade (both for me) and a turkey sandwich with cheese and mustard sauce (him.)  Both our plates arrived and were very nice...but no soup ever came.  Then we waited, thinking the soup and the silverware was coming, and we waited...and waited...and no soup - and still waiting.  My lovely companion got up and stole some place settings from somewhere else and in doing so we snuck into the kitchen to inquire about my soup.  They said they forgot - which was cool - but apparently they had put it away and it was going to have to be reheated which meant we ended up sharing everything...except the soup.\n\nNow for the food.....it was good - but not great.  It was somewhat bland.  It had great, fresh ingredients, but everything was tainted with something sweet.  The soup needed salt (they don't have any on the table) and the other items were meant to be sweeter - I guess.\n\nSo maybe this is a GREAT restaurant and I was just tainted by the slow service.

We either find something near where we plan to go, something in route, or just plain go out of our way to have some place that has gotten killer reviews. This place is not the third one yet, but was on our way (mostly) to Goodyear. We were headed out for a ball game (of course). \n\nFrom the direction we were heading, there was no real perfect exit to get off the 10, so we did a little round a bout thing. But, we got there and found it. Take a good look at the pictures, it helps when you are searching for this place. We got parked with no difficulty and were worried that the place might not even be open. It is pretty desolate around this area. Not too \"scary\" as Matt K's sister thinks, at least not at 10am in the morning. \n\nTHe place is cute. A triangular building with lots of windows. No huge sign to advertise, but maybe just being on YELP will help them. We walked in to the small main dining area. Lots of white ikea tables and chairs with cute flowers on all of them. Bright drapery covering the sunny side of the building's windows. Lots of natural light in here and very inviting. The staff greeted us right away and asked us to order up at the counter, as they do not have menus printed yet. So, I assume that is coming. \n\nWe walked through the doorway into more of a kitchen area that had a counter setup and a large board with menu items. There are daily lunch specials, about 6-7 breakfast items, a lunch menu and a heafty list of specialty drinks. This place is really a true \"Asian\" Fusion, incompasing all of Asia. But, with a dabble in a few extra places, we will just call this world fusion. There are lots of really creative dishes and things that I would not necessarily have put together. But, they work. \n\nI ordered a Calcutta Egg wrap. This was really unique. The tortilla and the egg were like one. Inside there were veggies (too many onions for me, I will omit them next time), including carrots, cilantro, and tomato. They give you a side of sweet chili sauce to top it. Other than the onions that I fished most of out, this was DELICIOUS. I am not sure how they did the egg, but I do not have to know. I just have to eat it. SG ordered a scrambled egg plate with stir fried asian veggies. He loved the combination and was surprised to find how great it all was together. \n\nWe both stepped outside our norms and also got a specialty tea. We ordered the Indian Chai. It was very good. There were lots of other choiced that tempted me, but this one struck me first. I would love to go back and try the Ginger Lemonade. I am a sucker for ginger!\n\nOverall, this is a good little place with some really fresh, tasty, creative menu items. I hope that the lunch traffic can sustain them, since they have such potential.

It was listed under drinks, but I didn't really imagine that it would actually come out in a glass with ice and a straw. I got over the presentation quickly. This was THE BEST gazpacho I've had in years. Totally pureed, garlicky, with breadcrumbs in the mix so it tastes a bit creamy. Basically, the real freakin deal. \n\nIt didn't take long for the rest of our meal to make it out. The pasta was really flavorful, with heaps of veggies piled on top of a hearty serving. The veggie sandwich wasn't a new favorite, but it wasn't bad, either. Both came with mixed greens salads and a vinaigrette. The salad was tender, the dressing was alright. \n\nWe had a bit of a glitch with our bill on the way out. Everything is manually entered into the system, old school style, so take a closer peek at your check. \n\nThere were lots of other tasty looking things on the menu like the Gypsy stew, pear and gorgonzola sandwich and some breakfast items, so we'll definitely be back.", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "vxgU5nh4tkNY4-NQI8lhvQ"}

My nephew ordered the chicken panini and it was delicious, but cost $7 because it comes with a salad.\n\nThere was a steady flow of patrons, so the food will rest assured be fresh. Not to many people know about the place which makes getting in and out easy. Best part is this location is directly across the street from ShopDevious.com so you can shop and eat on your lunch break with time to spare. \n\nOn the bad side, i tried to sit outside to enjoy the fresh air, but the street was so unleveled i ended up sitting sideways at the table which was on a downward slope, and my soup seeped over the edge until i could make a dent with the spoon, ending up all over my tray and plate. Next time i'll sit inside.

I am a fan and would definitely return! As far as Korean food goes, they had all the standard offerings of pork bone soup, kalbi, etc. and the much-anticipated and loved accompaniment of side dishes! the side dishes were good but of standard fair! the dishes that we tried (beef stir fry placed in lettuce wraps, deep fried sweet and spicy chicken, and chicken ribs and cabbage) were - for the most part - delicious and of heafy proportions! \n\ni quite enjoyed what we ordered - the chicken ribs (which translated means dark meat) and cabbage! a melange of cabbage, half cooked chicken morsels, sweet potato and onions (?) are served in a big flat pan over a portable gas burner - so it required a little bit of eater participation! they get the process going by turning on the burner and giving it a little stir, then they intermittently come back to stir it around and scrap the bottom of the pan where the sauce and meat/veg caramelize. what you're left with is a hot bowl of goodness that hits all the notes of sweet, spicy and savoury. we actually figured out what to order by covertly staring at (and eventually asking) the family beside us what they were eating. the aroma, the hot sizzling sounds and the overall appearance of what was going on at their table led us to overcome our chinese politeness to ask. \n\nthe other dish that resonated with me was the deep fried sweet and spicy chicken. our dining mates had it and at our next visit, *i* too will have it! it was delicious! maybe because i haven't had korean chicken in a while or possibly because it was simultaneously crispy + saucy, spicy + sweet (a favored flavour combo of mine), and light + toothsome. i don't know how this dish could possess so many opposing qualities but it did. i think it was battered in rice flour? or just something other than your regular cornstarch because it was a little \"stickier\" in texture - which i liked - so after your initial crunch down into the crispy exterior, your teeth meet a little resistance from the sticky-ish batter that hugs the meat and then through the tender chicken. i'm biased to sweet + spicy, so the sauce got me at first bite. i have to say, my \"can i try a piece?\" turned into more like 5+ pieces ... and to my shame, not of the small and dainty variety. oh and value wise, this dish was huge ... enough for dinner + lunch the next day (for 2 people).\n\nboth dishes came with the colourful purple rice - BIG PLUS in my books! \n\nthe only mediocre dish was the beef stir fry - and not worth really writing about. \n\noverall: 4* and a big kudos to the owner for being very helpful in explaining aspects of the menu to us", "type": "review", "useful": 3, "user_id": "tKAM0Qyg-8SeBla-DfUbgA"}

REASONABLE PRICE - that's the catch phrase here.\n2) Some who do not know quality Sushi may complain it's too expensive, but that's because they are comparing this place to Chinese run joints like Sushi on Queen, Sushi Time, etc.  This place has a Japanese sushi chef so to view this place with proper perspective, compare it to other joints that have Japanese sushi chefs.  Consider the costs at Hiro, Ematei and Nami.  All of a sudden the price isn't that unreasonable.\n3) When I give this place a 5 star rating, I do so considering the PRICE.  \n4) Do not ever order anything from the kitchen without consulting various review sites.  The kitchen chef is not talented in any way.  You come here for sushi and/or sashimi.  That's it.  \n\nWhat I usually get is the 20 piece sushi party plate @ $28.\n\nWhen Susur was working at his restaurant, long ago, he was often seen eating here.

I am a student with a limited budget, so eating out is an occasion (here a reward for having finished all my assignments), and the Thai restaurant I chose had to be a very good one.\n\nI looked at about 5 other places in town. Some were too expensive, some didn't offer enough in the way of veggie food, others were just too far away. I was considering a takeaway, when I suddenly noticed for the first time ever the Celadon which is just across the road from me. I can literally just cross the road and I'm on the doorstep. The next task was to check it was okay online. Yelp and other sites all pointed in the same direction: \"top notch\" and \"entirely faultless\" service, delicious authentic food and good value. Being so close, I had to check it out.\n\nThe menu is deceptive. It doesn't look very vegetarian, but it turns out they are willing to vegetarianize just about everything on the menu, are conscious about dietary problems and don't use shrimp paste! Yay!\n\nI booked for 7.30 today. Before 8pm from Monday-Thursday there is a pre-theatre menu, where you get a starter and a main for £12.99. Upon entering we noticed  that the place was pretty empty, there was just one other couple eating. We put this down to the out of the way location, but after half an hour it suddenly filled up! The interior is minimalist and tastefully decorated, nothing too intrusive. The waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered from the pre-theatre menu: spring rolls with sweet chilli sauce, pad thai with tofu. I ordered a green curry with tofu and thai sticky rice. My boyfriend Robbie thought his starter was a bit small, but very much enjoyed it and his main made up for the small starter size. His pad thai came with the peanuts and various spices on the side (to sprinkle over the noodles), and a small salad. He said it was delicious, but after tasting some of mine he looked jealously at my dish every so often. Mine was super spicy, with plenty of red chillies in the sauce, fragrant herbs and spices, big chunks of fried tofu and plenty of fresh crunchy vegetables. My rice came in a bamboo bag which was used to steam it. The portion size was massive, but it was so good that I ate more or less everything. \n\nThai puddings are amongst my favourites. Robbie opted for the banana fritter with coconut ice cream, whilst I went for the banana cooked in sweet coconut milk. Strangely enough, this is a quite nostalgic dish for me as I used to eat it a lot when I went out for dinner with my grandparents. It is relatively healthy in comparison to other dessert options, and really rather delicious. The presentation of both pudding was really beautiful, and Robbie wolfed his pudding down despite having declared he was stuffed a few seconds before. He added that it was the best part of the meal... \n\nFor £30 for two without drinks, it wasn't that expensive. I am not sure why Thai is always pricier than other places, but Celadon is cheaper than most but definitely superior to most. Fresh ingredients are well cooked, service is, as Emily H stated, \"flawless\".

Die beiden Einheimischen schlugen den Schwanen vor, weil es Esslingens einzige (Haus-)Brauerei darstellt. Die Hausbrauerei liegt mitten in Esslingens Altstadt an sehr ruhigem Platz, bei schönem Wetter kann man davor Platz nehmen. \nInnen war ich allerdings etwas enttäuscht. Von außen dachte ich, man betritt uriges gemütliches Brauereilokal - aber wer hat hier in den 70er oder 80er renoviert und ausgestattet? Schäußlicher und ungemütlicher Fliesenboden, Kunstlederbezogene billige Möbel - geht null. Derweil wären die Grundlagen da: massive Holzdecke, Riesenbalken sichtbar, Ausstattung erinnert zwar an engl. Club und nicht an Brauhaus, ging aber. Würde als Sofortlösung für den erhöhen Seitenraum vorschlagen, 2 große rötliche Teppiche auf Fliesen zu legen und Tische weiß einzudecken, dann sieht man weniger vom Boden und nix von den hässlichen Tischen mehr. Und auf Werbebierdeckel von Germanwings sollte auch verzichtet werden - schaut schäbig aus. Wie die Lage mit den Toiletten zu retten ist: keine Ahnung. Ich musste erst paar Stufen runter zum Tresen, dann Wendeltreppe runter, durch modrig riechenden Barraum durch, paar Treppenstufen hoch, wieder durch weiteren Kellernebenraum, paar Stufen runter und dann war ich da. Erfreulicherweise tiptop neu gemachte, saubere WC-Anlage. Aber beim Weg zurück (s.o.) verfliegt der Eindruck dann leider. \nDie Karte war sehr angenehm gehalten. Übersichtlich, klein und ergänzt durch Tages/Wochenkarte auf Schiefertafeln. Preislich eher für das Ambiente und den Service zu ambitioniert, aber Touris werden ja keine Stammgäste. Ich wählte:\n- Schwanen Märzen (0,3 für 3,20€) und später, will ja probieren\n- Schwanen Pilsener (0,3 für 3,20)\n- Geeiste sommerliche Tomatensuppe (4€)\n(Stand auf Tafel vor Gasthaus, beim Bestellen war sie aus, beim Verlassen des Lokals stand sie immernoch draußen..). Folglich umdisponiert:\n- Maultaschensuppe (4,50)\n- Spinat-Kokos-Suppe (ca. 5,00€ - beide Begleiter)\n- Zarter Kalbstafelspitz im eigenen Sud, Gemüsestreifen, frischer Kren und Kartoffeln (14,80€)\n- Kalbsfetzen Orientalisch mit Sucuk, Kichererbsen, Zwiebeln, Kartoffeln (18,80€ - Begleitung). \nDie Biere waren beide ok - aber recht charakterlos für kleine (Haus)brauerei. Meine Suppe schmeckte sehr gut. Die Maultaschen waren hervorragend und reichhaltig, die Brühe selbstgemacht. Die Spinat-Kokossuppe schmeckte nur nach Spinat, fand ich eher enttäuschend - optisch aber sehr ansprechend.\nDer Tafelspitz wurde in drei extra Teilen serviert: Fleisch im Sud, Kren, Kartoffeln. Alles für sich gut, aber blöd zu essen. Soll man Kartoffeln trocken essen oder in Sud tauchen? Hm, aber das Fleisch superzart, geschmacklich gut gelungen und der Sud merklich selbst und mit Liebe gemacht. Hätte aber alles auf Teller serviert und statt Kren eher Apfelmeerrettich zu Kartoffeln und Fleisch gereicht. \nBedient wurden wir mehrheitlich von junger, sehr junger Bedienung. Sie bemühte sich redlich, war aber limitiert in ihren Fähigkeiten, sich einfachste Dinge zu merken (Wer bekommt die Maultaschensuppe? Wer den Tafelspitz? Wer das kleine Bier? Wie zahlt man getrennt? ;-) Aber das wird vielleicht noch - schätze Lehrmädel oder Tochter des Hauses. In ihrer Art war sie auch freundlich und Wartezeiten waren völlig angemessen. \nFazit: Schön gelegenes Gasthaus mit vernünftigem Essen (3,5 Sterne). Innen gehört was gemacht, da fühlte ich mich nicht wohl.", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "Om5QDTDyRIV8l4_ZdDopDA"}

Immernoch ein Geheimtipp!\nWir waren (wieder mal) spontan und unanagemeldet in einem der besten esslinger Restaurants. Nach einer kurzen Wartezeit am sehr gemütlichen Tresen, wo wir schon mal unser hevorragendes Bockbier trinken konnten, bekamen wir einen wie immer angenehmen Tisch für zwei. Mit das Schöne am Schwanen ist, dass die Tische nicht wie in den meinsten anderen Restaurants auf \"Hautkontakt zu anderen Tischen\" gestellt sind, sondern genügend Platz dazwischen gelassen wurde, dass man weder gestört wird noch sich in der weite verlassen fühlt.\nAls Vorspeise nahmen wir einen frischen,knackigen, liebevoll angemachten Salat, der weder in der hausgemachten Tunke ersäuft war noch sich nach mehr Dressing sehnte und eine leckere Flädlesuppe wie von Muttern.\nAls Hauptgang hatten wir Rindezunge im eigenen Sud von der Tageskarte. Die Zunge zerging auf der Zunge, kam im Suppenteller schön angerichtet mit frischem, auf den Punkt gekochtem Gemüse und hervorragenden KArtoffeln. Ebenfalls von der Tageskarte, die immer herrlich ausgeglichen und einfallsreich gestaltet ist, kam der Zander auf Blumenkohlpürree, das samtig und leicht mit dem Fisch harmonierte.\n\nDie Küche war wie immer hervorragend, die Zutaten frisch und lecker zu bereitet, mit Liebe angerichtet und durch einen spitzenmäßigen Service kredenzt.\nDer Service im Schwanen ist wie immer nicht nur freundlich, sondern auch zuvorkommend. Sollte man Lust auf andere oder weitere Beilagen haben, bekommt man immer einen passenden und durchdachten Rat. Immer ist der Service sehr persönlich, geistreich und herzlich!\n\nDie Einrichtung wirkt keinesfalls \"billig\" wie hier von einem Vorkritiker beschrieben. Sicherlich ist die Einrichtung individuell, weil kreativ und nicht durchschnittlich. Die Massivholztische sind stabil und durchaus für ein \"Brauhaus\" passend. Die Sitzgelegenheiten sind gemütlich. Das Design der beiden Gasträume ist grundlegend unterschiedlich, was eine Bereicherung bedeutet. Wir fühlen uns hier sehr wohl.\n\nDurch die Anordnung der Tische ist trotz des offenen Raumes immer eine gewisse Intimität gewahrt. man hat eben so viel Abstand, dass man seine Ruhe hat, aber nicht soviel dass man sich verloren fühlt. Durch den zentralen, runden Abgang zum Kellergeschoss hat man eine schöne, für den Einrichter nicht unkomplizierte Raumaufteilung, die aber perfekt gelöst wurde.\nIm Eingangsbereich präsentieren schöne stilvolle Schränkchen die Spezialitäten, durch die der Schwanen besonders glänzt. Stehtischchen machen das Warten auf einen freien Tisch bei großem Andrang und fehlender vorheriger Reservierung angenehm. Auch hier wird man vom Service nicht einfach abgestellt, sondern betreut und gut versorgt.\n\nTatsächlich ist die Toilettensituation nicht so ganz beglückend. Das sind aber nun mal die baulichen Gegebenheiten. Aber auch hier glänzt das Brauhaus mit sauberen, durchdachten und neuen sanitären Anlagen. Nach einem ordentlichen Essen schadet ein kleiner Gang durch die Katakomben ja nun auch nicht...\n\nInsgesamt fühlen wir uns im Brauhaus zum Lamm immer sehr wohl, essen spitzenmäßig und trinken ebenso gut.\nBedienung\nSehr persönliche, immer freundliche und zuvorkommende Bedienung, die beratend zur Seite steht und alles Mögliche möglich macht.\nDas Essen\nsiehe Beschreibung\nDas Ambiente\nzum Wohlfühlen, ohne affektiert zu sein\nSauberkeit\nBedingungslos sauber.

Das Ambiente innen passt sich dem an: Eher dunkel gehalten, leider mit einem Kachelboden, so dass die Lautstärke nicht geschluckt, sondern eher hallend verbreitet wird.\nNeben der Speisenkarte, die in der Standardversion auch auf der Website zu finden ist, gibt es die aktuellen Angebote, die auf Schiefertafeln präsentiert sind. Die Auswahl kann man wohl mit \"gutbürgerlich\" umschreiben, fleischlastig zu Normalpreisen, oft auch als kleinere Portion angeboten.\nWir wählten als Vorspeise ein Urzitronen-Carpaccio (8,50 €): Diese Zitrone hat bei weitem nicht die gewohnte Säure, sondern kann samt Schale gegessen werden, wobei letztere den Großteil der Frucht ausmacht. Wäre sie hauchdünn geschnitten gewesen, wäre sie auch angenehmer zu essen gewesen, so war doch etwas kauen angesagt. Der Geschmack war bestens kombiniert mit Rucola, etwas Nüssen und Tomaten, also eine geschmacklich vortreffliche Idee. Die Kalbszunge (11,80 €) wurde in einem Suppenteller mit einem leichten Sud serviert. Die Zunge herrlich zart, dazu noch etwas Gemüse und Salzkartoffeln. Originell auch dieses in der Präsentation und gut. Wuchtig waren das Kalbshaxenfleisch (14,80 €) mit einer deftigen Sauce, Ratatouille und Rösti. Gut aufeinander abgestimmt und intensiv!\nDie Mandeltorte (6,50 €) war zwar warm, leider auch schon etwas trocken, was durch das gute Eis auch nicht \"geheilt\" werden konnte.\nDas hausgebraute Pilsener (0,5l für 4,20 €) kommt gut gekühlt und leicht trüb, könnte bei mir auch als spezifische Weizensorte durchgehen. Ein einfacher, aber ordentlicher Cuvée aus dem Umland liegt bei günstigen 20,00 €. Mir bekannte Winzer konnte ich auf der Weinkarte nicht finden, aber wir sind ja auch in einem Brauhaus.\nBeim Service hat die Chefin alles im Griff: Sie ist aufmerksam und kann zu allen Fragen klare und freundliche Antworten geben. Dies traf bei unserem Kellner nicht immer zu.\nIn Summe eine bodenständige Wirtschaft mit guten Speisenangeboten, schön die kulinarischen Wagnisse wie etwa die Urzitronen-Vorspeise.", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "pZdccDHtB6EN5W7v5z3npg"}

And on a cold wintry night, there's nothing more satisfying than classic French cuisine to fuel and fortify a body against the chill.\n\nOr if you're me, be a glutton and not be able to focus on anything else but a couch on which to play beached-whale during the entire trip home. I tried to solo this meal and perhaps that was not a good call. But I digress! Let's talk about the food.\n\nAfter I settle in at my table, an amuse comes out from the kitchen - a butternut soup with coconut foam. The scent of five-spice wafts up from the hot ceramic shot-glass and it is a delicious way to warm up. Quite nice.\n\nA hot bowl of French onion soup is up next - not too salty, really nice flavour, and islands of floating toasted crisps tangled in a mess of melted cheese. It's a hefty portion of soup, good for sharing. Of course, I ate it all by myself.\n\nThe kitchen clearly thought I didn't have enough to eat this evening (I had two - yes two - mains still yet to come), so a small quenelle of a duck terrine on a crisp gets placed in front of me. Meaty and a little vinegary, this mouthful was a nice way to perk up the taste buds again. A nice and unexpected treat.\n\nI couldn't resist and got the house-made pasta of the night: Linguine with pulled boar, mushrooms, and laced with truffle oil. There was mention of tomatoes, but it was a fairly light note. Rich and delicious, this was a deceptively large portion of pasta due to the plate being more bowl-like than you'd think. Very filling and worth a try if they still have it on the menu.\n\nBy now I was pretty full. And what's next? Cassoulet. It landed on the table and this plate of beans, half a sausage, and two confit duck legs mocked me. The peanut gallery of lardons laughed. I tried valiantly, but I got through half a leg, a slice of sausage, and a few spoonfuls of beans before I called it quits.\n\nThe waitress enquires if I want dessert? I'm stuffed, but of course!\n\nI opted for a pot de crème trio (it's small, right?) in mango, berry, and apple (in order of preference). The mango was light and delicious and not as mangoey as it could have been. Better that way, I think. The berry (cassis, I think), in contrast, was quite strong and worked well. The texture was a bit off though. I'd have opted to pass on the apple in the end.\n\nA pot of loose-leaf tea (earl grey. hot.), strong and black, accompanied dessert in an effort to make more room in my stomach. It did its job, though I still felt like I was going to explode.\n\nAll in all, a promising new neighbourhood place I'd return to sometime (can't think about when right now - too full). Added bonus is the fact that real French gets bandied about between the FOH and kitchens. Adds that extra je ne sais quois to the evening.\n\n(Check the blog for accompanying photos and menus)", "type": "review", "useful": 5, "user_id": "sccPVgHWRAww1atzaOfOYQ"}

Two confit duck legs, rosemary herbed sausage and white beans slow cooked until al dente and flavorful.

I also read the National Post's (http://tinyurl.com/4htvoet) review the day after visiting and although it was a little bit harsher than I would have said it, it was on the money. \n\nA bit of confusion finding our reservation at first, but once done we were warmly shown to our table. The wine list was a little overpriced ($14/glass for middle of the road) for what it had on it, but of the two glasses that I tried, they were nice accompaniments to what I ate. \n\nI started with the quintessential escargots and my wife had soup of the day - creme of pear and parsnip. The escargots were excellent. Plump and nestled nicely in butter and Gruyere. The soup was thick and rich and thankfully wasn't overpowering in either pear or parsnip. Nice little starter. \n\nWe also shared another special of the day - a small order of rabbit rillette with crostini. A little heavy on garlic but a light dish that was rather quickly devoured. \n\nMains next. I had the wild boar which was...ok. I partially blame myself as when I had the mental image in my head, it wasn't the same as the pork chop that appeared in front of me. The Yukon mash and carrots were delicate and lovely to eat. The roasted garlic / jus that came with the boar didn't add too much to the taste that was just familiar. The $27 price for this plate was a tad too much as well. \n\nNow, the moules et frites that my wife ordered were fantastic. Neither of us had ordered very many tomato-based mussel dishes (used to wine or curry/cream based) and this order was brilliant. Mussels were big fat bastards and picked up the broth flavour very well. Extra bread for dipping was definitely needed. Couldn't even finish the order. The mini-string frites were very tasty and the perfect lemon aioli dip was tip top. \n\nThe place filled quickly past 7-7:30 p.m. with every demographic possible, showing that this little placed is like by all. We planned it well time-wise, as with our table tucked in the corner near the ordering station, the place gets packed by 9. \n\nStaff were very friendly, pleasant and timed their visits perfectly. At least one server speaking French with a multitude of tables. \n\nGoing back to the Post's article, I don't know how the reviewer ate for $80, taxes in. Our meal with 2 glasses of wine, a pastis ordered with a shared dessert was $135 before tip.", "type": "review", "useful": 2, "user_id": "FTNaQZ3t0dsVWw1WZUQGFg"}

But, this place is too sweet not to share, so consider yourselves warned if you spot us in a corner, canoodling over crevettes. ;) \n\nStandouts here include the escargot poutine (yes, you read that right!) and the coq au vin.

It was melty white cheddar, apples, onion, and mustard on a grain bread. This baby was so good! I could have eaten 10 of them!...well maybe not, but I would love the stomach capacity to do so because this sandwich was bomb! It was served with a side of chips and a pickle spear. You could get a side of fries for an up-charge. \n\nI was there at noon and it was pretty dead.

I was surprised to find out that they were actually a vegetarian, organic cafe! While I don't live by either of these culinary choices, I still found their menu to be enticing and ordered the White Cheddar Apple Medley Panini.  It was served hot within 5 minutes, and my bill came to a little over $8 for the sandwich (which came with a pickle and side of chips) and beverage.  Not bad!\n\nThe sandwich itself was delicious. A great blend of flavors, though I found it a little difficult to eat at times. When I bit into the sandwich the apple wanted to escape and either ended up slipping out of the sandwich or hanging from my teeth. Not being one to leave a fallen sandwich behind, I trudged on and made a happy plate (or joined the Clean Plate Club, depending on which reference you fancy).

Their menu is completely vegetarian, and most of their menu can cater to vegans too. I ordered the cranberry panini and 3-bean chilli. My order came within 5 minutes, and it was the most delicious cranberry panini I had ever had. I was excited to see the wide variety of teas they had, and tried the ginger tea and the green tea.

There's also a small private room with a conference table in it.   Bathroom is clean and modern.  \n\nThen onto the ordering - it's fast casual style.   I was sort of reminded of a trip to the doctor's office because it was a really clinical experience.   The lady at the counter was really slow and rather uninspired by her work.  Turns out we'd interrupted her lunch, which she went out to the dining area to eat after she waited on us.  My lunch was served to-go.  Not sure why since she didn't ask. \n\nThe food was mixed.  The jalapeño popper panini I had was pretty good.  Creamy and cheesy, with a punch from some sliced jalapeños.   It was pretty large too.  The hash brown tater tots were straight from the Ore Ida bag.  Not bad, but pretty generic.   The sandwich, tots, bottle of water, and random bag of chips I didn't order came to just over $10.  \n\nA solid lunch cafe if you work in the area, but the menu is a tad limited and the service could use some work.", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "h9LPugJk2cpIh0gmQb5LnQ"}

Not so lucky for my pants which have been feeling the stretch of this staple of my diet for some time now. I don't know what it is about this burrito-maybe they warm the tortilla in butter before filling it with tasty beans and cheese. Maybe it's the fact that they likely cook those beans in lard, which let's be honest, makes all the difference. I don't know, but if I knew I could live off of these without dropping dead of heart disease, I'd do it. \n\nThere aren't many things I order here- the enchilada plate, the bean and cheese burrito and from time to time the carne asada nachos which are a day and a half's worth of calories and sodium, but worth it. I only recommend the carne asada when it comes to nachos- the chicken just has never been good when I've had it. Nothing to ruin a delicious plate of cheese and chips like dry flavorless chicken. My favorite salsa is the green-not too spicy and packs in some great tomatillo flavor. If you go inside you can get as many little containers of salsa as you want, which brings me to my next point. \n\nDon't get in the drive through lane unless you like to be tortured before your meal.

The sign advertises that they are \"like Porto's,\" where I've never been, but I understand is the west coast standard for Cuban bakeries. I also know that Porto's is approximately the size of the entire island of Cuba, which Roly's certainly is not. I'm from south Florida, where there's a lot more variety and competition for this style of bakery, but I can report that I'm very pleased to have Roly's here in Vegas.\n\nMy first visit (I was driving east on Tropicana and made a right turn with no notice when I saw a sign that said \"cuban coffee\"), I started with my standard order: cafe con leche and a guava-cheese turnover. The turnover was good, but did not fully meet my expectations (a bit dry? not enough cream cheese?), and I was disappointed when my cuban espresso with steamed milk was served unsweetened. In Florida, it is automatically assumed that you want sugar, or they will ask, already fully prepared to pour a full cup of sugar into the hot espresso. Only in Las Vegas, and a small Cuban cafe in Tucson, has my coffee left me wondering, where's my azúcar? Sure, I can sweeten it myself, but I don't enjoy the guilty feeling of dumping loads of sugar into my coffee cup. I could continue this rant, but instead I will note that I'm glad that I selected a slice of guava cake to take home, as it tasted fresh and moist and convinced me that Roly's deserved another visit.\n\nThe selections I tried on my second trip were better. I found a slice of the guava strudel more pleasing than the turnover with cream cheese from my first visit, and was introduced to the masareal de coco, two layers of dense, cookie-like cake sandwiched with a sweet coconut filling. I also love the tocinillo de cielo, a dense, yellow flan on top of a layer of sponge cake that helps soak up the caramel syrup. In addition to desserts, Roly's does have a menu of savory options. My husband has tried the traditional pressed sandwich, and said it was OK, but he doesn't have much Cuban sandwich experience for comparison. Having never sampled Cuban pizza, I ordered a veggie, which came topped with fresh spinach, onions, green bell peppers, cheese, and a sweet tomato sauce with a hint of cumin. The crust was more like a thick round of focaccia, so it was a very bready pizza. I'm glad to have tried it once, but probably would not order it again.\n\nPrices are very fair at Roly's: many of the desserts are under $1. Breakfast specials are cheap and worth checking out. Empanadas and papa rellena (those little fried mashed potato balls with a ground beef filling that people seem to be so obsessed with) are also available. Plus, the place is usually packed with Cubans taking multiple boxes of pastries to go.

Some being traditional items like cheesecakes, croissants, as well as their own selection of treats of Hispanic influence. Everything looked absolutely delicious, but I had to pass since I was there looking for a meaty lunch. Those sweet treats were put there to distract me when I had a sign to challenge.\n\nThe Cuban sandwich comes to about $8 + tax. It comes with the traditional works: ham, sliced pork, some pickles, swiss cheese, and mustard served between their own baked bread. In terms of flavor, the sandwich could have had more, especially with their sliced pork. It wasn't a bad sandwich, but it left me feeling indifferent. I kinda like my Cuban sandwich a bit more greasy and toasty. Sorry Roly's, but this was not the best Cuban sandwich. It was a bit to plain for my tastes. I have to admit that the thing was gigantic though.\n*3/5 stars based on the sandwich alone\n\nI decided to bump the overall rating to 4 stars due to how delicious everything else looked.

In front of UNLV is an old Strip Mall with Roly's facing campus. It's not much to look at from the outside.

Just point and pay - money speaks in all languages. My brother order a Hamburger.  The burger took about 10 minutes, and it smelled and tasted different in a good way.  There are several different types of burgers, but the regular $6.99 burger is a quarter pound patty, with a Cuban style bun.  Chorizo is blended into the meat patty, and cooked chorizo is part of the  toppings, along with mayo, and red bell peppers, I would give the burger 4 stars. It would be great with an IPA (which Roly's doesn't sell)\n\nPastries were kind of sparse at 5 PM but some good ones were still around. I opted to get a slice of mango cake, with sweet mango topping a white cake and mango puree topping with cream between the layers.. I also got a slice of tiramisu, my favorite thing of all we ordered.  It had a strong cocoa smell from the cocoa powder topping, with whipped cream and white cake layers.  I also enjoyed the guava cheese strudel, but it was a bit heavy and too sweet.  I liked the coconut pastry with the dried sweet coconut paste inside the pastry.  The rolito pastry, rolled yellow cake with pastry, was decent but not as good as the other stuff.\n\nToo bad we didn't taste the cakes.

Obviously a small space, and one not particularly easily identified from the street despite large billboards located down the street, it was just prior to 2:00pm that I entered the small Cuban bakery and with several folks seated and eating I took my time to peruse the options, a middle-age woman keeping a watchful eye on me until I was ready to go, my $10 order of one savory and three seats delivered to the table with a cup of water just five minutes thereafter.  Beginning first with the pork croquette sandwich, a pair of fried sticks filled with what I can best describe as 'pig puree' proving an acquired taste beneath tomatoes and Swiss cheese, I only ate one half before satisfying my curiosity and moving onward the guava-cream cheese pocket was indulged in similarly - a nice enough flavor, though most would find bottom of the wastebasket as I'd have simply preferred it more flaky and warm.  To this point largely underwhelmed it was onward to the meal's two best selections that I moved and although the 'cappucino' was two lovely bites of sponge cake rife with simple syrup it simply could not compare to the eggy custard flan, a world-class example with a lightly browned top and pockets of raisins amidst a sea of lightly sugared eggs.\n\nSmall, cozy, and pleasant in service Roly's is one of the few places where locals are able to indulge in Cuban baked goods, but with a limited selection and too much focus on 'everything to everyone' items like crème brûlée, cupcakes, and tiramisu I'd have rather see them focus on more esoteric specialties like Porto's in Los Angeles - the lack of several items, including the tres leches, in portions smaller than a full tray was particularly disappointing.", "type": "review", "useful": 1, "user_id": "U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA"}

We stopped in for a pastry and coffee to follow up lunch at Cuba Cafe. \n\nConfession: We had a full meal with appetizers, sides, entrees, dessert, AND coffee at Cuba Cafe but, upon realizing Roly's was just down the street and on the way home, we decided to turn our cheat meal into a cheat life. I'm not ashamed. \n\nThough I was unable to eat again until the next day, I'm both glad we visited and sad we didn't know about this place sooner. \n\nMy husband and I are recent transplants from LA where Cuban bakeries are abundant (Porto's and Cafe Tropical being two popular go-to's). I mention this because most of my experience with Roly's is best explained through comparisons from what I already know.\n\nWe ordered a guava cheese pastry, otherwise known as a pastel de guayaba con queso, and two espressos. \n\nThe coffee: It's very easy to percolate a pot of Cuban coffee at home but it's so refreshing to have it done for you on a much cooler industrial percolator.  Based on the cups used, Gavina is the grounds of choice here. Within minutes, two steaming cups were brought to our table and we were directed to the counter for our sweeteners. My Cuban husband was disappointed to not have his coffee made with the characteristic sugar slurry but, at the same time, having the option of using non-sugar sweetener was nice (sidenote: on our second visit today, we were asked if we wanted sugar already mixed in, which my husband enthusiastically accepted).\n\nThe pastry: We were served a pastry that was still warm and crusty. It was absolutely delicious. Here's where the comparison comes in: while the price point is higher at just a bit over $1 per pastry, it was more than generously filled with guava paste and cream cheese. The ratio was just about perfect, which I cannot often say about the pastries at Porto's. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rolys-bakery-las-vegas?select=ZfpGGDu42EwzKPPkAnDyNA#ZfpGGDu42EwzKPPkAnDyNA\n\nA quick scan of the cases and menu showed two things: cuban crackers and bread that we'd been missing all this time as well as breakfast served all day. The latter was what brought us back today. \n\nThere are four combos available: \n\n#1: 2 eggs, toast (Cuban bread), and coffee for about $5\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rolys-bakery-las-vegas?select=X0sEYYhXQ6bCbjH_f1SMRg#X0sEYYhXQ6bCbjH_f1SMRg\n\n#2: 2 eggs, toast (Cuban bread), pastry, and coffee for about $6\n#3: 2 eggs, toast (Cuban bread), ham croquette, pastry, and coffee for about $7\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rolys-bakery-las-vegas#24c6bmIEBCafd6T-POQqHA\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rolys-bakery-las-vegas?select=ciUJhawXmWuJhpW8pjXxrw#ciUJhawXmWuJhpW8pjXxrw\n\n\n#4: 2 eggs, toast (Cuban bread), marinated steak, pastry, and coffee for about $8 \n\nTo each combo, you can add ham, sausage, and other items for $1/each .\n\nIn addition, there are four omelette selections: western, spanish, veggie, and one other that escapes me. All come with a pastry and coffee. \n\nI ordered the #1 with fried eggs and added bacon. Now, at $1 extra for the bacon, I expected one or two small slices. What I got was THREE crispy thick slices. The eggs were fried perfectly to my liking. The toast? Well, what's there to complain about when you're given freshly buttered toasted Cuban bread?\n\nMy husband ordered the #3 with scrambled eggs and a guava pastry. First, it's clear the eggs used are real and not bagged. Second, my husband was thrilled to find that they're seasoned lightly with Sazon, a popular Latin seasoning blend that we use in his eggs at home. Now, the most important part. My husband loves croquettes but has learned not to expect much from any place that sells them. Today, that changed. He bit into his croquette expecting the usual mediocrity and, instead, his eyes lit up and he looked toward the kitchen said, \"Oh my god, MOM? ARE YOU IN THERE?\". I took a bite and can attest to the fact that these are the best croquettes I've had from an eatery. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rolys-bakery-las-vegas?select=XPrpcXPwngzgMdZljGUU0g#XPrpcXPwngzgMdZljGUU0g\n\nAll in all, breakfast came to about $13 before tip. We plan to come back for the Cuban pizza and, honestly, for more of everything else.", "type": "review", "useful": 5, "user_id": "5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA"}

Anyway, I am Dominican and I was born and raised in Miami. Many of my friends growing up are Cuban.  To this day, when I go home to Miami my dad goes to Riviera Bakery on 17th ave to get me an assortment of pastelitos. So, I consider myself an honorary Cuban pastry connoisseur.  With that said, I will say that Roly's is pretty good, for Vegas. \nI've had the pastelittos (pastries) - cheese, guava, guava with cheese and meat. All good, but not as flaky and yummy as I am used to. \nI've had the croquettes, and they are okay as well. \nI had a mango milkshake and a mamay milkshake and they were both good.  \nCan't go wrong with a cafe con leche.  \nSo here's the deal.  If you're expecting authentic \"from back home\" stuff, then you're going to be disappointed.  But, if you just need a little fast of home to get you through the day, week or months, then you'll be okay.  They do a good job and trying to make everything truly as Cuban as possible and you have to give credit where it's due.

I bought their $5 for $9 Worth of Hot Pressed Wraps or Panini Sandwiches deal and made my way over, excited to give them a second try since the last time I'd been here, they were still rather new. \n\nThe place was empty when I walked in. A waitress was standing there looking at me like I was a freaking alien, so I cheerily said \"Hi there!\" to HER. I said it to HER. She kept staring. I told her I'd gotten a Groupon Now deal as I went to sit at the bar. She nodded, but looked completely flustered and finally grabbed a menu for me and asked \"This is To Go?\" in a way that pushed me to say yes, even though I was expecting to eat there. She stood right in front of me while I was trying to figure out what to order while tapping her pen on the counter, making me feel rushed. \n\nI had planned on getting a panini, so I looked at the paninis (the menu has changed significantly since we'd been there) and quickly saw that NO panini was $9. They're either $10 or $11. uhhhhhh okay. So I looked through the wraps. They were all $6-8, so whatever. I'll lose my extra $1 in savings. No big deal, so I order an $8 wrap called Popeye something or other, trying not to think about how it seemed a little sneaky to offer a deal for something that forces you to pay more or save less once you get there.\n\nThe waitress puts my order in their system and I give her my phone with the Groupon code pulled up. She writes down the information and she hands me my phone back and I hold onto it for a little while until she walks away and then I hit the \"redeemed\" button. She came back from the kitchen area looking even more confused and flustered than before. She needed to look at the code again because it wasn't going in the system. I tell her that it can't be pulled up after it's been redeemed, but I can try? So I do and show her that the code is gone. She huffs and paces and taps her pen against the bar some more, making me feel really uncomfortable, until she finally goes to the back again and time passes. When she comes back, our conversation goes like this:\n\nWaitress: \"Oh my boss figured out why it wasn't working.\" \nNatalie G: \"Oh, okay that's good!\" \nW: \"It's because the Groupon is for a PANINI, not a wrap. When they put up the Groupon, it's not supposed to say wrap. So since you got a wrap, it's $8, not $9 like the Groupon says and that's for a panini\" \nNG: \"..............Come again?\"\nW: \"You have to pay $8 for the wrap\" \nNG:\"I have to pay $8 on top of the $5 from the Groupon? There aren't even any paninis that cost $9. And the Groupon says wrap... I don't think I understand why I would be paying extra.\" \nW: *huff huff pace pace tap tap pace huff*\n\nI finally tell her I want to speak to her boss or manager or whoever is back there and so she disappears again. When she came back, she hands me my food and just offhandedly tells me that \"It was taken care of.\"\n\nYEAH IT WAS TAKEN CARE OF. Where is my apology? Where was the manager? Why is this even an issue? Does the waitress know customer service at all? Good luck, Mumbles.

All the other people there were grumbling about this too;\n* They did not have the fried, cracked crab and the Dungeness crab as they advertised;\n* And they raised the prices on Thursday nite. Why wasn't I told that when I called on Thursday afternoon?\n* Further, they did not have a take-out option by the pound.

Not soggy and not dry--the PERFECT dim-sum quality texture\nbanana \"pudding\" (in squares): silky smooth, cool, and delicious\nunlabeled dessert that tasted like banana pudding with a tasty base of banana cake and bananas--it had the \"fake\" artificial banana flavor that my brother really enjoys\nunlabeled soft-serve \"ice cream\" that I strongly suspect was actually frozen yogurt--not watery, but a bit icy as frozen yogurt often is. I loved it, though, being lactose-intolerant and all\ncantaloupe-fresh!!!! It was actually FRESH!!!!! Oh, the joy of finding fresh fruit at a Chinese buffet\n\nMissing food (that is, what Pacific Buffet has that this place doesn't)\n\n-Crab legs: my mom said they used to have these, but Chinese families would grab 5-6 plates of crabs legs per person, in order to get their money's worth. Personally, I've always found crab legs at buffets to be bland and uninspired\n-Pineapple RIce\n-Red bean paste bun shaped like a peach\n-More sashimi/sushi offerings\n-frog legs\n-hard scoop ice cream (green tea amongst other flavors)\n-sweet dessert soup (with white fungus, gingko nuts, and dates/longan)\n-BBQ pork buns (actually it might have been Phoenix Palace that used to have this way back when it was a buffet)\n\nPrice: $9.99+tax. Best deal EVER.\n\nFor the value, City Buffet has the freshest seafood in town. Almost everything was authentic (no overly sauced, greasy, \"spicy\" Americanized Chinese food here) and that might be the problem. Chinese people like authentic Chinese food, but they would never go to a buffet unless it had expensive items like crab legs and sashimi--otherwise, they can just prepare it at home. I'm afraid this hidden gem might close down or worse, descend to the depths of bad American Chinese. And there's far too much of that already.\n\n4.5 stars (but I'll round up)", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "GtY92e_A39HpCW8LF9pnTw"}

Even though I am Chinese, I would not say I'm a Chinese food snob. I firmly believe that amazing Chinese food and dim sum can be found outside of San Francisco and yes, even in buffets. I love myself a good Chinese buffet and have been to much better ones.\n\nBUT, this place is just bad\n\nAs a disclaimer, I do not eat seafood, so it was partly my fault for coming here. I can't comment on those dishes, but I can't imagine them being very good based on the other dishes\n\nI started with noodle bowl station. This is really what convinced me to stay here since I love noodles. Well, the wonton were tiny and bland, while it seemed like they put three noodles in the bowl with a huge amount of broth. The beef stew noodle was also lacking in the amount of noodles and the noodles were still clumped up. The beef was so tough, and there were 7 or 8 pieces of anise in the bowl. Too much.\n\nThe mongolian grill was next as I figured, this will be better since I can choose my own stuff. NOPE. There was hardly any flavoring in the stirfry, the meats were awful quality, and no sauces really to flavor it all.\n\nThey have standard \"Chinese\" buffet fare like beef broccoli, spring rolls and orange chicken, in addition to some dim sum. The dim sum buns were hard and these dishes just tasted unappetizing. Blah. The spring roll was especially offensive. The only thing that I enjoyed were the fried wings, which I stuck to after discovering everything else was not good.  \n\nSave yourself the trouble and find another buffet if you're hungry.", "type": "review", "useful": 2, "user_id": "Y8O0dlUOU43qpzz6soRaRg"}

As a lover of spicy foods, I added a comment for it to be hot and spicy just out of past experience with every other Thai restaurant I have eaten at. Well ... I am not about to blame Mango for the 35 dollar price tag to get this single order 2 minutes down the road to my house .. BUT .. The next few hours proved to be an heated experience that I wouldn't wish upon anyone. 2 Litres of water didn't even get me through half the Pad Thai. It was fine with my friends to laugh at my attempts to eat this Noodle INFERNO but I had to stop. I don't need to expand on the extreme pains keeping me up from 4 am to 6:30 that night.\n\nThe next day I wrote to their website and after no reply I went to their restaurant and simply asked them to give me another Pad Thai without the ridiculous heat. They said they couldn't but they would have the Manager call me. .. They didn't call. \n\nI have just got home after a return trip to Mangos and after a lengthy chat with the Manager that included some drivel about \"Racial Profiling\" when I mentioned I never had such heat in a dish from other establishments, their reply was that restaurants would tone down the heat for people like myself. LOL .. OK ... So when you deliver to strangers via take out, you turn the heat back up? I asked myself. .. Here was someone willing to give their restaurant another chance to redeem themselves and I'm in a verbal volley over a 12 dollar dish!\n\nMy theory after they offered me 50% off, was to waive them of my business and to vent a little here. I'm sure their food might be very good but there is a Thai restaurant across the street.

Weird.\n\nOh, did I mention that the place is also filthy?  I'm not really a big stickler for a really clean restaurant or sparkling floors but a pair of spring rolls and some napkins underneath my feat is going a bit far.  Maybe that was the appetizer?\n\nTo give it to them, a 5.99 daily special is pretty enticing, that's what I ordered.  It was a plate of jerk chicken with coleslaw and rice & peas.  It also came with a soft drink of your choice.  It was a pretty good deal in my mind.\n\nThe chicken was dry and not really flavourful...

Not overly friendly, but I was acknowledged.\nWalking in I noticed how different this place was set up to other restaurants, as they had a little cafe-type area to the left, and a pool table/stage in front/to the right.  The whole place was very bright and clean, and had music playing softly in the background.  I didn't realize until I was leaving that it was gospel music; which in hindsight makes sense considering the restaurant name.\n\nI ordered the large jerk entree, chicken fingers and fries, and the slushie special.  The slushie was a pina colada flavour, about 16oz for $1.00, and it tasted AMAZING.  After finishing it, I wished I had gotten another for myself before leaving the store.  The chicken fingers and fries to be honest, were horrible.  They tasted worse than something I would have ruined at home.  The chicken was the same kind as nuggets from a slimy fast food chain or low-cost frozen nuggets, and the fries were unseasoned.  For $7.99, I was extremely unimpressed. \nThe jerk entree my boyfriend ordered looked fantastic.  It was a huge portion (4 hefty sized legs) tons of rice and peas, with a spicy coleslaw.  I tried some of his meal, and while the jerk was too spicy for my taste everything was cooked wonderfully.  His $8.99 was hands-down worth the price, and made my meal seem worse by comparison.  He was able to eat his portion for three separate meals (lunch, dinner, lunch the following day).  My meal,  I tried eating what was left for lunch the following day, and I got about 4-bites in before I started feeling extremely sick.\n\nOverall I would definitely go back to this place, but I would steer clear of the \"American\" dishes, as I feel the love and attention is more placed into the Caribbean-style dishes.\nAlso: if you are sensitive to spicy food, avoid the jerk and go for the fried chicken instead.

But beware - I got one of these so called $2 breakfasts and by the time I was done, it cost me $5 - but that's because I added bacon and tomato and they never told me how much extra it was (given, I could barely understand the girl but that's my own fault for not clarifying). If you want to pay a toonie, stick with the basics. I'll add that I don't eat a lot for breakfast usually and not eating breakfast at home is rare, so the small grilled cheese sandwich (plain the second time) was enough to get me through the morning til lunch but my male coworker, who values quantity, complained about how small it was. The full blown grilled cheese with bacon and tomato WAS a great option for the \"feeling iffy morning-after-a-night-of-drinking \".\n\nThe veggie wrap is rather nice - for something without meat in it, its a filling but light-feeling meal. Also, not too much sauce or stuffing, just the right amount. The Turkey Bacon club is yummy but its also rather large. I have a hard time finishing the entire sandwich and usually someone at work finishes the other half for me.\n\nFor a place that claims to be healthy, they've only recently added nutritional information to their website and I was a bit put off by some of the values they had for my favourite meals. However, that being said,  you can eat at Fit For Life without having that guilty \"I just ate McDonalds\" feeling and feel full and satisfied at the same time.", "type": "review", "useful": 0, "user_id": "vJGLEHyhCs9V-5fAe-xx3w"}

The selection is pretty standard for the area. Most of the pizza joints in 15210 are pretty much the same. This place is a step or two below the rest, unfortunately.\n\nWe got a medium pepperoni pizza and a small capiccola hoagie. The hoagie was great. Crispy, crunchy bread. A good hefty portion of spiced ham. I asked for banana peppers and they were quite liberal with those. The hoagie was quite nice...and again pretty standard for the area.\n\nThe pizza wasn't too great. The crust was nice and crispy, big plus. There was alot of cheese on it....salty, oil and nutty. The only complaint was the sauce...which tasted like canned tomato sauce...no spices or nothing. It was tart and very basic...very bland. Normally I don't fret so much over the sauce as long as the crust is spot on...but they slathered on way too much sauce and it kinda just killed the pizza for me.\n\nThe price for a medium 1 topping pizza and a half hoagie plus delivery fee was $18.01...like I said quite pricy for the area. They had a bunch of coupons for specials where we have gotten like twice as much food for just a couple bucks more....but we didn't need a whole hoagie and a large pizza...it woulda been a waste.\n\nAll in all...this place is just a little below average. We had the pizza before and we remembered it not being all that great. This second time confirmed this. The hoagies are good though, but plenty of other places in the area have hoagies just as good.

I haven't tried any of the meat dishes, but they look good on other people's tables.

In Spain, tapas can be as inexpensive as .99 cents of a Euro and in a lot of bodegas give you selected number of them for free.

Yum! Giulana witnessed me ate the whole order by myself!\n\n*Potatoe Sambousak -  Potato and onion puree wrapped in puff pastry, three pieces dressed with mezziki - brownish looking.. too bad those are not mini chocolate cakes.. dry and uninspiring!\n\n*Exotic Green Beans - Crisp-fried green beans, shaved onion, dill and garlic, dressed spicy hot - not spicy hot at all! But the beans were cooked well, crunchy and fresh! My fave of the night!\n\n*Mushrooms - Tender sautéed button mushrooms served in a garlic vinaigrette - standard, ok but not too exciting!\n\nNot Sharing: (But I made them share with me)\n\n*Kofta - spiced minced beef balls served in a rich tomatoe sauce - Not bad, but not really outstanding..\n \n*Dream Sausage -  Flame-grilled beef-lamb sausage, spiced with herbed hot sauce (Stole from Tony F) MEH.. too lamby!\n\n*Fish Shish -  Tasty, marinated marlin or swordfish, flame-grilled, 2 skewers (Stole from Giulana B) - GREAT! light and refreshing with a hint of lemon\n\n*Lamb Shish - Savoury chunks of marinated lamb leg, flame-grilled, 2 skewers (Stole from Tony F) - Surprised that I like it! Rich flavour without lamby taste\n \n*Vine Leaves -  Herbed minced beef and spiced Basmati rice wrapped in vine leaves and dressed with garlic yogourt and dill (Stole from Giulana) - hey I have no idea I should eat the leaves.. Chinese don't eat the leaves we used that as a wrapping!\n\n*Chicken Shish -  Delicate, juicy marinated chicken breast, flame-grilled - A-OK, but not really memorable!\n\nI have a really enjoyable meal... the bills come out to be $15 per person with taxes and tips. I think I don't mind going on a Toonie Tuesday as a value oriented person that will be the way to go!!\n\n*Special thanks for Tony F and Giulana for letting me try their food..

Enter Enzo - I've no idea what their background is, but given that there's one Pizza Pizza down the street, two Pizzaiolos within a 5 min walk, and North Of Brooklyn (their direct competitor) immediately around the corner... let's just say it's a bold move.\n\nOn my way to pick up pizza for the team at NoBo, I dashed in to grab some from Enzo for a direct comparison.\n\nI ordered both the Francesco (mushroom, mozz, olives, sausage, artichokes, roasted red) and Pepe (calabrese pepper, pepperoni, onion, olives). Flavour-wise, they sorta tasted the same, though I want to say I liked Pepe better. Both were decent picks, though I don't have a lot of recall on them - I was distracted by work. I'd probably give both a go again some time to check. Co-workers voiced that they liked North Of Brooklyn better (we also had NoBo's Margh and Puttanesca the same day).\n\nBut *I* clearly liked Enzo enough to return.\n\nSo, I had the Enza (buffalo mozz, fresh basil) today for lunch and really liked this one. The basil was nice and aromatic, the buffalo mozz was fresh and faintly buttery. Photo: https://twitter.com/foodpr0n/status/328945872253640704/photo/1\n\nThe crust: I like. On the thick side of thin and with good chew (more chewy than I think many people may like). The bake is just-toasty, and no significant charred bits. Gives it a nice (and even), crispy, outer shell. Taste of the dough is faintly sweet.\n\nOverall, I like it. I feel the ingredients are good, the dough is tasty, and the cost is moderate (well, on the upper edges of that). Wasn't revelatory as that first bite of Libretto pizza years ago, but it's a good pie. Worth a try if you're in the area.", "type": "review", "useful": 12, "user_id": "sccPVgHWRAww1atzaOfOYQ"}

On a positive note, anything with their earthy, smoky chicken chili is decent, their guacamole is fresh and light, and their homemade red chili and avocado salsas are zesty and tasty.\n\nRelatively cheap prices and a student discount is the icing on the cake (or the guac on the nachos, I guess).
